\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The carbon chain has four carbons and hence the ending of the name would be: butane. Also there are two iodines (iodo substituents) attached to the carbon chain. As there are two of the same iodo atoms, we need to use the prefix \emph{di}. The full name would be: 
\begin{flushright} \mytriangleright{dgreen}\small Answer: Dioiodobutane. \end{flushright}
