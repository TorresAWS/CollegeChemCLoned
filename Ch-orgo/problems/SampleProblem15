\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Classify the following molecules as an amide or amine:
\begin{center}\chemfig{-[:45]-[:-45]-[:45](=[:90]O)(-[:-45]NH_2)} \hspace{0.5cm}\chemfig{-[:45]-[:-45]-[:45]N-[:-45]}  \end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The molecule in the left is a amide as the carbonyl group (\ce{C=O}) is connected to a nitrogen atom. Differently, the molecule in the right is an amine as the nitrogen group is not connected to any carbonyl group.
\begin{flushright}  \mytriangleright{dgreen}\small Answer: (left) amide; (right) amine. \end{flushright}
