Name the following hydrocarbon:
\begin{center} \chemfig{CH_3-C(-[:90,1]F)(-[:-90,1]I)-Br}\end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The carbon chain has two carbons and hence the ending of the name would be: ethane. Also there are three different substituents: iodine (iodo substituents), bromine (bromo substituents) and fluorine (fluoro substituents). We need to order them according to the \emph{abc}, hence the order would be: bromo, then fluoro and finally iodo. The full name of the alkane would be: 
\begin{flushright} \mytriangleright{dgreen}\small Answer: Bromo-Fluoro-Iodoethane. \end{flushright}
