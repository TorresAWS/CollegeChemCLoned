Classify the following molecules as alcohol or ether.
\begin{center}\chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-OH} \hspace{0.5cm}\chemfig{CH_3-O-CH_2-CH_3}  \end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The OH groups is an alcohol, and we find this group in the left molecule. Differently, the right molecule is an ether as it contains the \chemfig{R-O-R'} group. \\
