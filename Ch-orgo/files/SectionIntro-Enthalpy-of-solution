Some chemicals favorably mix. For example, table salt and water or oil and cyclohexane. Others such as water and cyclohexane do not mix. Like dissolves likes is the rule behind miscibility. Understanding why chemicals mix at the molecular level is the key to understanding solubility. Thermodynamics can give some insight into why chemicals mix. In particular, an enthalpy analysis of mixing, and understanding the energy effects involved in solubility can give some partial insight into solubility. Still, it is important to acknowledge that energetics--energy considerations--is only part of the answer, and the spreading of energy has to be included in this analysis to achieve a complete picture of solubility.
