 You have certainly taken painkillers for a headache or over-the-counter drugs to get over a cold. Maybe you drink coffee and perhaps you like tea. All these substances contain active organic molecules. These active molecules are hydrocarbon derivatives and differ from plain hydrocarbons, which are simply made of carbon and hydrogen. Active molecules contain functional groups such as alcohol, ethers, carboxylic acids, amines, amides, or aromatic groups. These groups of atoms have a specific function and give activity to the molecule. The goal of this section is simply to identify the different groups.
