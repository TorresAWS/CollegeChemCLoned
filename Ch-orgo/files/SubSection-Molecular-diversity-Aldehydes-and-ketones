Ketones and aldehydes both contain a \ce{C=O} group. Still, these are two different groups, and ketones have a \ce{C=O} group bounded to two different carbon atoms

whereas aldehydes have the same \ce{C=O} group but this time bound to a carbon and a hydrogen.

Examples of aldehydes and ketones are:

Ketones are good solvents. For example, acetone is commonly found in nail polish removes for example. Aldehydes have strong smells. For example, vanillin is an aldehyde responsible for the vanilla smell. Cinnamaldehyde is responsible for the cinnamon odor.
