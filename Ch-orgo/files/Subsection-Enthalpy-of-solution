Large, positive  $\Delta H^{soln}$  values correspond to endothermic solution processes, that is, the solute would absorb energy when dissolving (e.g. \ce{NH4Cl}). Small, negative  $\Delta H^{soln}$  values correspond to exothermic solution processes, that is, the solute would release energy when dissolving (e.g. \ce{LiBr}). $\Delta H^{soln}$ values for numerous solutes are given in Table  \ref{tab:Table-Enthalpy-Solution}.
For the case of \ce{LiBr} we have that the enthalpy of solution is -61KJ/mol, while the energy needed to expand the solute is 807KJ/mol (the lattice energy of  \ce{LiBr} is -807KJ/mol). The enthalpy of hydration for \ce{Li^+} is -520KJ/mol and for \ce{Br^-} is -348KJ/mol. The overall enthalpy of hydration (-682KJ/mol) is smaller in absolute value than the energy needed to expand the solute giving an overall, negative enthalpy of solution. Therefore, the large solvation energy of the salt makes the dissolution of \ce{LiBr} exothermic.
