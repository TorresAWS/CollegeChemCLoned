Overall, the rules to name alkanes is:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf} Look for the longest chain that will give the ending name of the molecule.
\item \begin{bf}Step two:\end{bf} Number the main chain starting at the end closes to the substituents so that the numbers for the substituents are small.
 \item \begin{bf}Step three:\end{bf} Name the substituents with their position and order them alphabetically.
\end{enumerate}
