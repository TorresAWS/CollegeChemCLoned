Alkenes contain at least one double bond. Ethylene is the smallest of all alkenes with just two carbon atoms. Let us analyze its structure:
\begin{center}
\chemfig{C(=[:0]C(-[:45]H)(-[:-45]H))(-[:130]H)(-[:-130]H)}
\end{center}
Every carbon center in the double bond has three $sp^2$ orbitals and two empty 2$p$ orbitals. The three $sp^2$ orbitals combine, giving three $\sigma$ bonds. Two of these are used to bond carbon atoms with two hydrogens, whereas the remaining bond is used in the C-C bond. One of the empty 2$p$ orbitals forms a $\pi$ orbital in the double bond. Therefore, for every double bond, we have a $\sigma$ and a $\pi$ orbitals. $\pi$ bonds are rigid, as the $p$ orbitals involved in the bond need to be lined up parallel to the three  $\sigma$ bonds (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-bonding-of-ethylene}). Differently, $\sigma$ bonds are mobile and as such, free rotation is possible.

Alkyles contain at least one triple bond. Ethylene, also called acetylene, is the smallest of all alkynes with just two carbon atoms. Let us analyze its structure:
\begin{center}
\chemfig{C(~[:0]C(-[:0]H))(-[:180]H)}
\end{center}
The triple bond in acetylene can be understood as a $\sigma$ bond with two $\pi$ bonds between the carbon atoms. Similar to double bonds, triple bonds are rigid.
