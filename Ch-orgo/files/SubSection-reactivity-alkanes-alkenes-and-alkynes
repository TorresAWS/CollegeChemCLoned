Alkanes are almost inert materials under normal conditions. They do not react with acids, bases, or oxidizing agents. This is because of the C-C and C-H strength. As such, alkanes are used in the manufacturing industry to produce plastics and lubricants. At high temperatures ($\Delta$), they can undergo \emph{combustion reactions} with oxygen.
\begin{center}\ce{CH_4 + 2O_2 ->[$\Delta$][] CO_2 + 2H_2O}\end{center}
Alkanes can also react with halogens undergoing \emph{substitution reactions}, in which one or more hydrogen atoms of the alkane are replaced with a halogen. In this reaction, ultraviolet light h$\nu$ is needed to break down the halogen (e.g. \ce{Cl_2}) producing very reactive halogen radical (e.g. \ce{Cl^{.}}): an atom with an unpaired electron.
\begin{center}\ce{CH_4 + Cl_2  ->[h$\nu$][] CH_3Cl + HCl }\end{center}
Halogenated alkanes have many uses. For example, \ce{CF_xCl_{4-x}} are chlorofluorocarbons or freons. These chemicals were historically used in air conditioning systems and can present a threat to the ozone layer.
Alkanes can also undergo \emph{dehydrogenation reaction} producing alkenes as hydrogen atoms are removed by a reducing agent at high temperature:
\begin{center}\ce{CH_3-CH_3   ->[\ce{Cr2O3}][500$^{\circ}$C] CH_2=CH_2 + H_2 }\end{center}
Alkenes and alkynes undergo \emph{addition reactions} as hydrogen, or halogens can add to the multiple bonds, replacing a $\pi$ bons with a $\sigma$ bond. Alkenes can hydrogenate at normal temperature with the use of a Ni or Pt catalyst.
\begin{center}\ce{CH2=CH2 + H2 ->[Pt][] CH3-CH3}\end{center}
This reaction is involved in the manufacturing of solid shortenings from liquid, unsaturated fats. Similarly, halogens can add to a triple bond:
\begin{center}\ce{CH#CH + Cl2 ->[][] CHCl=CHCl}\end{center}
