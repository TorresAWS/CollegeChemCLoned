Organic compounds are chemicals mostly made of carbon and hydrogen, containing chains or rings of carbon atoms. Here a few examples of organic compounds: \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H6}, or \ce{C6H6}. Differently, inorganic compounds contain elements other than carbon and hydrogen. Examples of inorganic compounds are: \ce{NaCl}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{HCl},Â  \ce{FeO} or \ce{NaOH}. Mind that carbonates (\ce{Na2CO3}), carbon monoxide (\ce{CO}) or carbon dioxide (\ce{CO2}) are not organic compounds.
Originally the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds was made based on whether the chemical comes from a living system. Indeed organic compounds were thought of as synthesized only from living organisms. This belief was disregarded after Friedrich W{\"o}hler was able to synthesize urea--a component of urine--from ammonium cyanate, an inorganic salt:

Alkanes are simple organic compounds made of carbon and hydrogen with all carbons connected using simple bonds--these are single lines representing the connections between atoms. The simplest alkane and the simplest organic compound is methane: \ce{CH4}, a fuel and the main constituent of natural gas.

Its structure is representative of organic compounds in general as it shows that each carbon atom in an organic molecule is connected to four different atoms.
