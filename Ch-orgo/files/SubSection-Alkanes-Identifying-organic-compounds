Organic compounds are chemicals mostly made of Carbon and Hydrogen. Here a few examples of organic compounds: \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H6}, or \ce{C6H6}. Differently, inorganic compounds contain other elements than Carbon and Hydrogen. Examples of inorganic compounds are: \ce{NaCl}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{HCl},Â  \ce{FeO} or \ce{NaOH}. Mind that carbonates (\ce{Na2CO3}), carbon monoxide (\ce{CO}) or carbon dioxide (\ce{CO2}) are not organic compounds.
Alkanes are simple organic compounds made of Carbon and Hydrogen with all carbons connected using simple bonds--these are single lines to represent the connections between atoms. The simplest alkane and the simplest organic compound is methane: \ce{CH4}, a fuel and the main constituent of natural gas.

Its structure is very representative of organic compounds in general as it shows that each carbon atom in an organic molecule is connected to four different atoms.
