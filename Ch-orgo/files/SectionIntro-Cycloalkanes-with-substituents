The naming rules for cycloalkanes are the same as the rules for naming linear alkanes. This means first you will find the ending of the name by counting the number of carbons in the cycle. Then you will locate each substituent and number the carbon chain so that the position numbers are small. Finally, all substituents should be ordered alphabetically.
