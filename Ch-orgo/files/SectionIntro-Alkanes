This first section will introduce organic chemistry, covering the simplest organic compounds: alkanes. Alkanes--also called hydrocarbons--are simply made of carbon and hydrogen with all C-C bonds being single bonds. First, you will be introduced to a few organic chemicals, and you will learn about a series of different organic formulas that can represent the same compound. Then, you will learn the basic naming rule of alkanes, which extends to other--more complex--organic chemicals.
Hydrocarbons composed of single C-C bonds are called saturated hydrocarbons, whereas hydrocarbons containing multiple C-C bonds are described as being unsaturated. All carbons in a saturated hydrocarbon are bound to four atoms. You can produce saturated hydrocarbons by reacting an unsaturated hydrocarbon with hydrogen:
