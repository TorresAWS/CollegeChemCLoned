\item[\docfilehook{Alcohol, ether and thiol group}{}] Alcohols contain an \ce{-OH} group attached to a carbon.

Whereas ethers have oxygen atoms attached to two carbon atoms:
\begin{center}\chemfig{R-O-R'}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{Ether}\end{center}
Examples of alcohols and ether are:

Thiols contain a  \ce{-SH} group attached to a carbon. They are equivalent to alcohols but based in sulfur:
\begin{center}\chemfig{R-SH}\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{blue}{thiol}\end{center}
Examples of thiols  are:
\begin{center}\chemfig{CH_3-CH_2-SH}    \hspace{0.5cm}  \chemfig{CH_3-CH(-[:90]SH)-CH_3}  \end{center}
Thiols are responsible for the characteristic smell of rotten eggs and burned hair.
