There are many different substituents--also called groups--that can be found attached to an alkane chain. Their names are indicated in Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter}. The easiest substituents are halogens; atoms of chorine (\chemfig{Cl-[:0,1]}), bromine (\chemfig{Br-[:0,1]}) or iodine (\chemfig{I-[:0,1]}) can replace hydrogen atoms in an alkane. The name of these substituents--chloro, bromo, and iodo-- resembles the name of the corresponding atom. Other substituents can contain carbon, like a methyl (\chemfig{CH_3-[:0,1]}) or a ethyl (\chemfig{CH_3CH_2-[:0,1]}). There are even more complex substituents such as tert-butyl in which a central carbon atom is connected to three different methyl groups. The name of substituents (methyl) comes from the name of the alkane (methane) by replacing the \emph{-ane} suffix with \emph{-yl}.
