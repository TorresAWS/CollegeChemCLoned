There are a few relevant alcohols, both simple and complex alcohols. The simplest alcohol is called methanol, \ce{CH3OH}. It was originally called wood alcohol as it can be produced by heating wood in the absence of air. It is produced from the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide catalyzed by supported chromium(III) oxide:
\begin{center}\ce{CO + 2H2 ->[400$^{\circ}$C][Cr2O3/ZnO] CH3OH}\end{center}
Another important alcohol is ethanol \ce{CH3CH2OH}, which is produced in the fermentation of glucose (\ce{C6H12O6}) catalyzed by yeast
\begin{center}\ce{C6H12O6 ->[yeast][ ] CH3CH2OH + 2CO2}\end{center}
This reaction only proceeds until the alcohol concentration is 13\%. After that point, yeast can not survive the high alcohol level and distilling is necessary to produce high-alcohol beverages. Ethanol can also be produced by means of the hydration of ethane catalyzed by phosphoric acid:
\begin{center}\ce{CH2=CH2 + H2O ->[H3PO4][ ] CH3CH2OH }\end{center}
Rubbing alcohol is a liquid-base solution made of either isopropyl alcohol or ethanol. Finally, 1,2-ethanediol known as ethylene glycol is a toxic chemical used as car antifreeze.
