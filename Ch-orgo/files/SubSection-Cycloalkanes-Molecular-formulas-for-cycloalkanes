\item[\docfilehook{Molecular formulas for cycloalkanes}{}]  The molecular formula for a general cycloalkane with $n$ carbon atoms is:
\begin{equation}
 \text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}
 \label{formula12.2}
 \end{equation}
 As an example, the formula for cyclopropane ($n=4$) is \ce{C4H_{8}} and the formula for cycloctane ($n=8$) is \ce{C_8H_{16}}.
