At this point, you have seen four different ways to represent organic molecules. Using propane as an example, here are all the formulas: We have that the \emph{molecular formula} (e.g. \ce{C3H8} for propane) is mainly used to indicate the composition of the molecule in the form of Carbon and Hydrogen atoms. A second way to represent propane is using its \emph{expanded structural formula}, that is by representing all atoms in the molecule and all atomic connections. A third molecular representation is the \emph{condensed structural formula} that uses \ce{CH3} and \ce{CH2} units, only representing the C-C bonds. Finally, the \emph{skeletal formula} is perhaps the most simplistic representation as only the C-C bonds are represented in the form of simple lines. It is important to understand that \emph{all formulas are just different ways to represent the same molecule}.
