Aromatic compounds are unsaturated hydrocarbons with increased stability and unique chemical properties. Benzene represents the simplest of all aromatic compounds. In this molecule, all carbon atoms are equivalent. A combination of the localized electron model and hybrid orbitals provide insight into the properties of benzene. The localized electron model justifies this equivalence through two equivalent resonant structures. The orbitals model describes each carbon using three $sp^2$ orbitals that form three $\sigma$  bonds (one C-H and two C-C bonds), while a remaining 2$p$ atomic orbital creates a $\pi$ delocalized orbital. The circle inside benzene's ring represents a combination of all delocalized $\pi$ orbitals. This electronic delocalization gives benzene unique chemical properties. This section will address the reactivity and nomenclature of aromatic hydrocarbons.
