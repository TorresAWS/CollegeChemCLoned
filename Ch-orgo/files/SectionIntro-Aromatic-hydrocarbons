Aromatic compounds are a special type of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Benzene represents the simplest of all aromatic compounds. In this molecule, all carbon atoms are equivalent. On one hand, the localized electron model justifies this equivalence through the existence of several equivalent resonant structures. On the other hand, the orbitals model described each carbon using two $sp^2$ orbitals that form $\sigma$ C-H and C-C bonds; the remaining 2$p$ atomic orbital is used to $\pi$ delocalized orbitals, represented by a circle inside the ring.
