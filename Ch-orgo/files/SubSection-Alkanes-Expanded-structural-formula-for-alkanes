At this point, we have addressed the molecular formulas of three simple alkanes: methane (\ce{CH4}), ethane (\ce{C2H6}), and propane (\ce{C3H8}). However, these formulas do not inform about the molecular connetions. The structure of ethane and propane is shown below:
\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[help lines/.style={thin,draw=black!50}]
\node at (0,0) {\chemfig{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-H}};
\node at (0,-1) {\textcolor{blue}{Ethane, \ce{C2H6}}};
\node at (6,0) {\chemfig{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-H}};
\node at (6,-1) {\textcolor{blue}{Propane, \ce{C3H8}}};
\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}
These structures show that each carbon connects to four different atoms, and each hydrogen connects to only one atom. The formulas presented above are called \emph{expanded structural formulas} as all atoms and all bonds connecting these atoms are shown, representing the molecular structure.
