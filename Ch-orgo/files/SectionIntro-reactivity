Organic chemicals can react with each other in a similar manner as inorganic compounds react. For example, we know that inorganic acids and bases react with each other to produce salts. Similarly, organic acids--carboxylic acids--react with organic bases--amines--to produce organic salts: amides. At the same time, carboxylic acids can also react with alcohols producing esters, which are indeed organic salts as well--known as soaps. This section addressed some of the reactions undergone by organic chemical compounds.
In this chapter, reducing or oxidation conditions will be represented as \ce{->[$[$reduc$]$]}  and \ce{->[$[$ox$]$]}, respectively, as many reagents can carry out oxidations or reductions.
