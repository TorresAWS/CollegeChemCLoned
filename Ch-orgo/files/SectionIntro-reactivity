This section addressed some of the reactions undergone by organic compounds. 
For example, carboxylic acids can also react with alcohols producing esters, which are indeed organic salts, commonly known as soaps or gels. 
In this chapter, reducing or oxidation conditions will be represented as \ce{->[$[$reduc$]$]}  and \ce{->[$[$ox$]$]}, respectively, as many reagents can carry out oxidations or reductions.
