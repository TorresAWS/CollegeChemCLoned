This section addressed some of the reactions undergone by organic compounds. 
For example, carboxylic acids can also react with alcohols producing esters, which are indeed organic salts as well--known as soaps. 
In this chapter, reducing or oxidation conditions will be represented as \ce{->[$[$reduc$]$]}  and \ce{->[$[$ox$]$]}, respectively, as many reagents can carry out oxidations or reductions.
