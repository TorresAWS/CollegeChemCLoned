Carboxylic acids can also react with alcohols producing esters, which are indeed organic salts as well--known as soaps. Hence, organic chemicals react with each other in a similar manner as inorganic compounds react: we know that inorganic acids and bases react with each other to produce salts.  This section addressed some of the reactions undergone by organic compounds. In this chapter, reducing or oxidation conditions will be represented as \ce{->[$[$reduc$]$]}  and \ce{->[$[$ox$]$]}, respectively, as many reagents can carry out oxidations or reductions.
