       \item  Stirr, and do not shake. It is very important to stir the cyclohexane constantly and gently until it is completely frozen.
	\item   Make sure the wire stays around the thermometer and that the latter is centered in the test tube.
	\item   The thermometer should not touch the walls of the test tube.
	\item   A bad stirring method will lead to a partial freezing and the graph will not show straight lines.
