       \item  To ensure the probe is well cleaned and the water in the 250 mL beaker remains clean, the conductivity meter should display a value close to that of the distilled water during the cleaning.
       \item  If the conductivity value of the cleaning water differs from the one of distilled water, replace the water in the 250 mL beaker with fresh distilled water, and thoroughly clean the probe.
