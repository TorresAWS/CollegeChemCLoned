    \begin{itemize} [label={\ding{45}}]
       \item  In the lab, like in the kitchen, some amounts are illustrative and some amounts are precise. Amounts referred to as \textit{"about"}, \textit{"approximately"}, \textit{"some"},  \textit{"a couple of"} are illustrative and do not need to be measured with precision tools. When making quantitative experiments the amount will be indicated with precision.
       \item  A \textbf{pea-size amount} refers to the size of a pea. A pea is a most commonly green, occasionally golden yellow, or infrequently purple pod-shaped vegetable. It is very similar to the Japanese Edamame but about the half of the size and not so tasty. It is comparable to the size of the orange eraser in the top end of a pencil.
	\item  A \textbf{tip of a spatula} refers to the amount contained by the first millimeter or two of a laboratory spatula. It would be comparable to the black part of the tip of a pencil, when it is not very sharp.
