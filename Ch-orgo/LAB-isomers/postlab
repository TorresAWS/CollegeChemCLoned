\begin{enumerate}
\item A Similar amount of both unknowns are used for their characterization in Parts A and B. Why is it important to use similar amounts? What would change if the amounts used were very different? \vspace{4cm}


\item How can you prove that the isomerization process was successful? \vspace{4cm}


\item Why did you cool down the solution after the isomerization?\vspace{4cm}

\item What would happen if hot water was used to wash the filtrate?\vspace{2cm}
