The goal of this experiment is to understand the concept of \textbf{isomerism}. During this practice, the student will identify two different molecules based on their properties. Later, a simple reaction will be carried out in an attempt to transform each molecule into its corresponding isomer. The student should be able to identify the new products based on the first observations (i.e. the properties of each molecule) and to validate the success of the transformation. The experiment will also familiarize the students with the separation technique known as suction filtration.
