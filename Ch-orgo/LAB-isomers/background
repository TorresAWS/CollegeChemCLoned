%\subsection*{Isomers and Geometric Isomers}

Consider a set of Lego\textregistered \:blocks with different sizes and colors. We can combine them in numerous ways to construct many different structures. Similarly, if those blocks were atoms, we would obtain different molecules from the same set of atoms. Isomers are molecules with the same number and nature of atoms, and therefore the same molecular formula, but with different structures. Diverse structures arise from variations in the bonds between atoms and lead to new molecules, with different names and properties.\\

\emph{Geometric isomers} are a subclass of isomers where not only the number and nature of the atoms are the same, but also the bonds. In this case, it is the spatial distribution or 3D structure that differs. This little change can lead to considerable differences in basic properties such as melting points and solubilities.
In molecules with four ligands distributed around a central atom or a double bond, the isomerism can arise from the distribution of those four ligands around the molecule, leading to \textit{cis-} and \textit{trans-} isomers. This is the case in the proposed experiment.

%\subsection*{Isomerization}

The process of \textbf{isomerization} is the transformation from one molecule into its corresponding isomer. This transformation does not take place spontaneously but typically requires external energy and, in some cases, specific conditions. Energy is necessary to break certain bonds to allow the molecule to restructure into the corresponding isomer.
