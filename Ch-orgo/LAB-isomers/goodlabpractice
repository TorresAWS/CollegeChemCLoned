		\item The burner should stand stable with no additional support. Coil the tubing at each end to stabilize the burner. 
		\item Work safely and avoid burns.
		\item Always ensure easy access to the gas valve. Remove any items around the valve, and do not set the flame on your way.
		\item Never leave the flame unattended. In case of accident or any risk, close the gas immediately.
