\item[\docfilehook{Average atomic mass }{}] 
The average atomic mass represents the mass of the atoms of an element and results from all existing isotopes taking into account their abundance. The units of atomic mass are called \emph{amu}, which stands for atomic mass units. This value can be simply found at any periodic table. Using the periodic table provided in this manual Figure\ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}1}, you can find the atomic mass of each element on top of the symbol at the right side. For example, the atomic mass of oxygen (\ce{O}) is 15.999 amu and the atomic mass of nitrogen (\ce{N}) is 14.007 amu. As atoms are made of numerous isotopes--this means different atoms of the same element but with different number of neutrons and hence different weight--the atomic mass found in the periodic table is an average that result from including the mass of the different isotopes and their abundance. That is you need to do an average of the mass of each isotope using values of abundance. In another words: the \textit{average atomic mass} of an element--herein called simply atomic mass--, expressed in $amu$ (atomic mass units), is the weighted average of the masses of the individual isotopes of the element. For an element with $n$ isotopes with different masses ($A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_n$) and different fractional abundances for each isotope ($f_1$, $f_2$, .., $f_n$ ), the atomic mass is given by
\[\text{Atomic mass}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i\cdot f_i=A_1\cdot f_1+A_2\cdot f_2+ \cdots  +A_n\cdot f_n\]
 Also, note that when adding the fractional abundaces of all isotopes, one should obtain a value of one:
 \[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}   f_i= f_1+ f_2+ \cdots  +  f_n=1\]
