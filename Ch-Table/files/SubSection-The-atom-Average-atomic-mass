As atoms are made of numerous isotopes--this means different atoms of the same element but with a different number of neutrons and hence different weights. The average atomic mass (also called atomic weight) represents the mass of the atoms of an element and results from all existing isotopes taking into account their abundance. It is the average of the masses of the naturally occurring isotope weighted according to their abundance expressed in atomic mass units or daltons. 
We can think of \% \emph{relative abundance}, and for example, the  \% relative abundance of \ce{^1H} is 99\%. But we can also think of \emph{fractional abundance}, that in the case of \ce{^1H} would be 0.99.
For an element with $n$ isotopes each with different masses ($A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_n$) and different fractional abundances ($f_1$, $f_2$, .., $f_n$ ), the atomic mass is given by
\[\text{Atomic mass}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i\cdot f_i=A_1\cdot f_1+A_2\cdot f_2+ \cdots  +A_n\cdot f_n\]
 Note that when adding the fractional abundances of all isotopes, one should obtain a value of one:
 \[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}   f_i= f_1+ f_2+ \cdots  +  f_n=1\]
Atomic masses can be simply found in any periodic table for each element. For example, the atomic mass of oxygen (\ce{O}) is 15.999 amu and the atomic mass of nitrogen (\ce{N}) is 14.007 amu. The atomic mass found in the periodic table is an average that results from including the mass of the different isotopes and their abundance.
