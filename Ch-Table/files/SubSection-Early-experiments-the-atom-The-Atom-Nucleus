Ernest Rutherford carried further experiments to understand the atomic structure hence validating the plum pudding model of the atom. He exposed a thin sheet of metal foil to $\alpha$ particles known to be massive and possitively charged particles. Following the plum pudding model, the bulky $\alpha$ particles should crash through the thin foil and traverse through without being deflected. However, the results did not corroborate his expectations. Indeed, some particles traversed the film, whereas other were slightly deflected and some were strongly deflected at large angles. These observations did not corroborate the plum pudding model. They contributed to a different vision of the structure of the atom in which a large number of positive charges were concentrated at a point--called the nucleus-- instead of being spread whereas the electrons move around the nucleus at large distances from it.
