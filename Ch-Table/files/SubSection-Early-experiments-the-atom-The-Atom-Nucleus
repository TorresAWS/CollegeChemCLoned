Ernest Rutherford carried further experiments to validate the plum pudding model of the atom (see Figure \ref{Figure-Rutherford}). He exposed a thin sheet of metal foil to $\alpha$ particles known to be massive and possitively charged particles. According to the plum pudding model, the bulky $\alpha$ particles should have crashed through the thin foil and traverse through without being deflected. However, the results did not corroborate his expectations. Indeed, some particles traversed the film, whereas other were slightly deflected and some were strongly deflected at large angles. These observations did not corroborate the plum pudding model. However, they contributed to the creation of the modern atomic mode in which a large number of positive charges were concentrated at a point--called the nucleus-- instead of being spread whereas the electrons move around the nucleus at large distances from it (see Figure \ref{Figure-Models-of-the-atom}).
