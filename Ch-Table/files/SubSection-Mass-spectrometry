Mass spectroscopy is a technique used to determine the isotopic composition of an element. With this technique, we can measure the relative mass and abundance of small atomic particles. In this technique, high-energy electrons collide with atoms or molecules to form ionized atoms. For example, if Ne would be analyzed, high energy electrons would produce \ce{Ne^+} characterized by its mass charge ratio, m/e. Different isotopes would have different m/e ratios. The positively charged particles produced after the impact would be attracted toward a series of negatively charged plates with slits in them. Some of these particles would pass through the slits into an evacuated tube exposed to the effect of a magnetic field. As the particles enter the evacuated region their paths are bent so that the lightest particles (low m/e) are more deflected than the heaviest particles (high m/e). Finally, the particles would stick to a detector recording their relative position and abundance. The spectrometer also provided the mass ratio of an isotope with respect to the mass standard, \ce{^12C}.
