 Overall, the elements of the periodic table (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-The-periodic-table}) can be classified as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids. Metals are those elements on the left of the table and nonmetals are the elements on the right of the table. The elements between metals and nonmetals are called metalloids and include only B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, Po, and At. Metals are shiny solids and usually melt at higher temperatures. Some examples of metals are Gold (Au) or Iron (Fe). Nonmetals are often poor conductors of heat and electricity with low melting points. They also tend to be matt (non-shinny), malleable, or ductile. Some examples of nonmetals are Carbon (C) or Nitrogen (N). Metalloids are elements that share some properties with metals and others with nonmetals. For example, they are better conductors of heat and electricity than nonmetals, but not as good conductors as metals. Metalloids are semiconductors because they can act as both conductors and insulators under certain conditions. An example of metalloids is Silicon (Si) which should not be confused with silicone, a chemical employed in prosthetics.
