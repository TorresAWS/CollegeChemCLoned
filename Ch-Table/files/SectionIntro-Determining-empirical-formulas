We said that the formula of a chemical that takes into account the correct number of atoms in a molecule is the molecular formula and therefore the real molecular weight of a chemical comes from these formulas. Empirical formulas are obtained from experiments in which a chemical is fragmented and analyzed so that the elements in the molecule and the mass percentage of each element are determined. Molecular formulas are obtained by using the molecular weight of the chemical and the empirical formula. Mind that the formula of a chemical that takes into account the correct number of atoms in a molecule is the molecular formula and therefore the real molecular weight of a chemical comes from these formulas. Let us work on an example to learn the procedure of obtaining molecular formulas.
