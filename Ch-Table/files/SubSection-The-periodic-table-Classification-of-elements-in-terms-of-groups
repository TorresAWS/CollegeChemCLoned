 Some of the groups in the periodic table have specific names such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, chalcogens, halogens, or noble gases. Alkali metals are the group 1A elements: lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). Alkali elements are soft and shiny metals, and they are also good conductors of heat and electricity, with low melting points. Alkali earth metals are group 2A (2) elements: beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). Transition metals are the elements from groups 3 to 12 and they are located in the middle of the table. Chalcogens are group 6A (16) elements: oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and polonium (Po). Halogens are group 7A (17) elements: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). Halogens are very reactive elements. Finally, noble gases are group 8A (18) elements: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). They are inert and rarely combine with other elements in the periodic table, like a noble family: have you ever met a royal?
