In the last part of the nineteenth century, scientists came to the discovery that some materials were able to produce high-energy radiation. Among the scientist working in this field, Henri Becquerel discovered that pitchblende, a mineral containing uranium, was able to produce an image on a photographic plate in the absence of light. In the early twentieth century, three different types of radiation were discovered: alpha radiation, beta radiation, and gamma radiation. Further studies revealed that gamma radiation was made of gamma particles, high-energy radiation, whereas beta radiation was made of high-energy electrons. Alpha particles were found to be positively charged, with a charge twice the charge of an electron and a mass 7300 times that of the electron. These particles were indeed Helium's nucleus, resulting from removing electrons from atoms of Helium.
