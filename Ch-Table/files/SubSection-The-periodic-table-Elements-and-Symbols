 Elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances. For example, aluminum is an element only made of aluminum atoms and if you analyze the composition of a piece of this metal you would only find aluminum atoms. Chemical symbols are one- or two-letter abbreviations that represent the names of the elements. Only the first letter is capitalized and if a second letter exists in the element\textquotesingle s name, the second letter should be lowercase. For example, the chemical symbol for aluminum is Al, written as capital A and lowercase l.
