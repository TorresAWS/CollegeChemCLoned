The English researcher J.J. Thomson investigated electric discharges in partially evacuated tubes--tubes in which the air has been partially removed. these tubes are also called cathode-ray tubes and are the base of old-fashion, bulky televisions. Thomson found that by applying high-voltage to these tubes rays--called cathode rays--emanated from the cathode of the tube, the negative electrode of the tube. These types of rays were repelled from the negative pole of an electric field. These rays were postulated to be a stream of negatively charged particles, now known as electrons. By studying the deflection of these rays by an electric field, Thomson was able to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{   \frac{e}{m_e}=-1.76\times 10^{8}C/g   }
\label{formula:Charge-to-mass-ratio-electron}
\end{equation}
 where:
\begin{where}
 \item $e$  is the charge of an electron	
  \item $m_e$ is the mass of an electron
\end{where}
The main discovery Thomson made was that all atoms are made of negatively charged particles. As atoms are charge-neutral, they are also made of positively charged particles. These observations led to the \emph{plum pudding model} that envisioned atoms as a diffuse cloud of positive charges with negative electrons embedded in it. The name plum pudding comes from an English dessert that contains a raising spread on it.
Further experiments from Robert Millikan revealed the magnitude of the electric charge of the electron. Millikan used an apparatus that dispersed charged oil droplets that fell under the influence of an electric field. By knowing the applied voltage and the droplet mass one can calculate the droplet charge. Millikan found that the oil drop charge was always a whole-number time the electron charge, $e$=$1.60\times 10^{-19}$C, where a Coulomb is a unit of charge. With the value of the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron and the electron charge, Millikan was also able to calculate the mass of an electron, $m_e$=$9.11\times 10^{-31}$kg.
