 At first sight, hydrogen (H) may seem to be put in the wrong spot on the periodic table (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-The-periodic-table}). Although it is located at the top of Group 1A (1), it is not an alkali metal, as it has very different properties. Thus hydrogen does not belong to the alkali metals, being nonmetal.
