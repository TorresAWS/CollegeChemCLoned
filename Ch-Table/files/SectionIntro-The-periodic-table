The periodic table (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-The-periodic-table}) is a chart containing all known elements arranged in increasing number of electrons per atom in a way that elements with similar chemical and physical properties are located together. The periodic table contains all existing elements--some of them are synthetic others are natural--that form the matter arranged in columns and rows. Every element has a different name accompanied by a symbol that represents its name. The tabular arrangement of elements in the form of rows and columns allows further classification of the elements according to their properties. This section will cover the different features of the periodic table.
