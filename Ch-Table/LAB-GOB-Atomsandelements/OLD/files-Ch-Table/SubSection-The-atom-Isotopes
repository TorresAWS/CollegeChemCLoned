\item[\docfilehook{Isotopes }{}] 
All atoms of the same element are not the same. Some are heavier than others. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons and therefore with different mass number but with the same atomic number. For example:  \ce{^{24}_{12}Mg},  \ce{^{25}_{12}Mg} and  \ce{^{26}_{12}Mg} are three isotopes of Mg.  \ce{^{27}_{12}Mg}  is heavier than  \ce{^{24}_{12}Mg} as it contain more neutrons and protons in the nucleus. Each of the isotopes has a specific abundance, as some isotopes are more abundant than other. For example, the abundance of \ce{^{24}_{12}Mg} is 79\%, and the abundance of  \ce{^{25}_{12}Mg} and  \ce{^{26}_{12}Mg} is 10\% and 11\%, respectively. This means, \ce{^{24}_{12}Mg} is more abundant than for example \ce{^{26}_{12}Mg}.
