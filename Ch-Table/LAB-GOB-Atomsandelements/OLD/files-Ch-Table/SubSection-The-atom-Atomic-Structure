\item[\docfilehook{Atomic Structure}{}] 
Atoms contain three atomic particles: the proton, neutron, and electron. Protons have positive charge (\ce{+}), whereas electrons carry negative charge (\ce{-}). Neutrons on the other hand are neutral, and they have no electrical charge. Protons and neutrons are located in the core of the atom, which is called the nucleus, and account for the mass of the atom. Electrons are delocalized in the exterior part of the atoms. They are not necessarily located in a specific spot and their existence spreads in the area next to the nucleus. When an atoms is neutral it has no charge and the number of electrons and protons are the same. Some atoms have positive charge, resulting of removing electrons, and we call these cations. Others--called anions--can have negative charge as a result of accepting a negatively charged electron.
