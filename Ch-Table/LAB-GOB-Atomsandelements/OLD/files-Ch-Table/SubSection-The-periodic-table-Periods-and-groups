\item[\docfilehook{Periods and groups}{}] The periodic table contains all elements arranged in rows and columns. The horizontal rows are called \emph{periods} and the vertical columns are called  \emph{groups or families}. For example, the  first period contains hydrogen (H) and helium (He), whereas the second group contains Beryllium (Be), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), Strontium (Sr), Barium (Ba) and Radium (Ra). There are seven periods (periods 1-7) and 18 groups. Some of the groups are labeled with an A (e.g. group 8A) whereas others are labeled with a B (e.g. group 8B). The groups numbers can be found written with roman numbers and a letters (A or B) or with a more modern group numbering of 1-18 going across the periodic table. For example, the group 2 (Mg-Ra) can also be called IIA, and the group 13 (B-Ti) is also known as IIIA.
