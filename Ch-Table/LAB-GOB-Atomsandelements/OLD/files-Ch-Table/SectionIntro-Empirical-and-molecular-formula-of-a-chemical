There are two different types of formulas: molecular formulas and empirical formulas. Empirical formula (EFs) are simplified formulas resulting from an experiment, whereas molecular formulas (MFs) are exact formulas of molecules. For example: the molecular formula of hydrogen peroxide, a mild antiseptic used on the skin to prevent infection of minor cuts, is \ce{H2O2} as the hydrogen peroxide molecule is made of two oxygen and two hydrogen atoms. Differently, the empirical formula of the same chemical is \ce{HO}, being this the result of the simplification of \ce{H2O2}. One can obtain empirical formulas simply by dividing the molecular formula by the smallest integer number, of course, given you know the molecular formula. The word empirical means "from an experiment", and the use of empirical formulas comes from the fact that the formulas of all chemicals actually come from experiments, and from experiments one normally can only obtain ratios of atomic composition.
