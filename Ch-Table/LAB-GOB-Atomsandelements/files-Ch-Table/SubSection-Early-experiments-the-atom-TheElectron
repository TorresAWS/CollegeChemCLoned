The English researcher J.J. Thomson investigated electric discharges in partially evacuated tubes--tubes in which the air has been partially removed; these tubes, made of a positive and negative electrode, are the base of old-fashion, bulky televisions. Thomson found that rays emanated from the negative electrode when applying high-voltage to these tubes.
These rays were names cathodic rays as the negative electrode of the tube is called the cathode. Thomson also found that cathodic rays were repelled from the negative pole of an electric field. Hence, these rays were postulated to be a stream of negatively charged particles, now known as electrons. By studying the deflection of these rays by an electric field, Thomson was able to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{   \frac{e}{m_e}=-1.76\times 10^{8}C/g   }
\label{formula:Charge-to-mass-ratio-electron}
\end{equation}
 where:
\begin{where}
 \item $e$  is the charge of an electron	
  \item $m_e$ is the mass of an electron
\end{where}
Overall, the biggest of Thomson's discoveries was that all atoms are made of negatively charged particles. As atoms are charge-neutral, they are also made of positively charged particles. These observations led to a new atomic model, the \emph{plum pudding model}, that envisioned atoms as a diffuse cloud of positive charges with negative electrons embedded in it. The name plum pudding comes from an English dessert that contains a raising spread on it.
A different scienticts, Robert Millikan, revealed the magnitude of the electric charge of the electron. Millikan used an apparatus that dispersed charged oil droplets falling under the influence of an electric field. Given the applied voltage and the droplet mass, Millikan was able to calculate the droplet charge. He found that the oil drop charge was always a whole-number time the electron charge, 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{   e =  1.60\times 10^{-19} \text{C}  }
\label{formula:electron-charge}
\end{equation}
where a Coulomb is a unit of charge. With the value of the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron and the electron charge, Millikan was also able to calculate the mass of an electron, 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{    m_e = 9.11\times 10^{-31} \text{kg.}  }
\label{formula:electron-mass}
\end{equation}
