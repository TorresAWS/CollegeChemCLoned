Calculate: (a) The atomic weight of O; (b) the molecular mass of molecular oxygen, \ce{O2} \\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) According to the periodic table the atomic weight (AW) of O is $15.999$ amu. (b) The molar mass of \ce{O2} is the result of adding the atomic masses of 2O atoms, that is $31.998$ amu, close to 32 amu.\\
