\vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 1. Empirical formula of an oxyde}
The goal of this mini experiment is to calculate the formula of an oxide. You will do this by burning up a metal .
\begin{steps}
      \newstep[] Obtain a crucible with a lid, a clay triangle and an iron ring attached to a ring stand. Place the covered crucible in the clay triangle on an iron ring attached to a ring stand. Adjust the height of the ring so that the bottom of the crucible will be in the hottest part of the flame. The correct arrangement of the equipment, crucible, and burner is shown in the figure (Right panel).

%\end{figure*}


        \newstep[] Learn how to use the Bunsen burner. Heat the covered crucible in the hottest part of the flame for about 5 min while keeping the lid ajar, making sure that the bottom of the crucible attains a red glow.
       \newstep[] Stop the burner and allow the crucible to cool down completely. Weight the covered crucible and record the mass of the covered crucible.     
\end{steps}
\begin{steps}[resume]
    \newstep[] Obtain 0.2 g of magnesium ribbon. Clean the surface of the metal with metallic wool until it shines. Cut the magnesium ribbon into tiny bits using scissors, and place them inside the crucible. Cover the crucible, obtain and record the mass again. Now you know the mass of the crucible+lid+Mg.
       \newstep[] Set the crucible on the clay triangle with the lid on and heat the crucible in the hottest part of the flame another 5 min. Keep the lid close. Using the crucible tongs, lift the lid carefully by a slight amount. The metal should glow brightly without flames. Continue until all Mg is burned and the product does not glow.
              \newstep[] Patiently cool down the crucible with lid. The content should be white or slightly gray. At this point, add a few drops of water using a plastic pipet on the crucible content. You might notice a smell of ammonia at this point.
       \newstep[] Place the lid back onto the crucible, slightly ajar, and heat the crucible  in the hottest part of the flame for 15 more minutes. After that time, allow the covered crucible and its content to cool down. Obtain the mass of the covered crucible.
       \end{steps}

 \vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 2. Thermal decomposition of a hydrate}
The goal of this mini experiment is to calculate the percentage of water contained in an hydrate. You will achieve this goal by heating up the hydrate and measuring its mass before and after heating. The difference in mass will be the mass of water contained in the hydrate.
\begin{steps}
    \newstep[] Place a clean, covered crucible in a clay triangle on an iron ring attached to a ring stand. Adjust the height of the ring so that the bottom of the crucible will be in the hottest part of the flame. The correct arrangement of the equipment, crucible, and burner is shown in the figure (Right panel).   
        \newstep[] Learn how to use the Bunsen burner. Heat the covered crucible in the hottest part of the flame for about 5 min, making sure  that the bottom of the crucible attains a red glow.
       \newstep[] Stop the burner and allow the crucible to cool down completely.         
       \newstep[] Weight the covered crucible  and record the mass of the covered crucible.

       \newstep[] Weight about 1.5 g of the hydrate.
       \newstep[] Add the the hydrate sample onto the crucible and cover the crucible again. Weight the covered crucible with the chemical and record the exact mass in the results sheet.
       \newstep[] Heat up the crucible in the hottest part of the flame for about 15 min. The bottom of the crucible should be red hot during this time.
       \newstep[] When the crucible is cool, weight and record the mass of the product. 
       \end{steps}
 



 \subsection*{Calculations}
\mycircled{1} Record the mass of the empty crucible with the lid. Remember to weight the crucible in the balance only when completely cool.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{2} Record the mass of the empty crucible with the lid with hydrate.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{3} The mass of hydrate added to the crucible should be:
\[\text{Mass of }\ce{hydrate}= \: \mycircled{2}\: - \: \mycircled{1}\] \vspace{0.5cm}
\mycircled{4} After you heat the crucible with hydrate a product will form. Weight the crucible and lid with the final product inside.\\ \vspace{0.5cm}
\mycircled{5} You should calculate the mass of product by doing:
\[\text{Mass Product=} \: \mycircled{4}\:-\: \mycircled{1}\] \vspace{0.5cm}
\mycircled{6} Calculate the mass \% of water in the hydrate:
\[\frac{\text{(Mass  hydrate)} - \text{(Mass Product) }}{\text{(Mass of hydrate)}}\times 100 = \frac{\mycircled{3} \: - \: \mycircled{5} }{\mycircled{3} }\times 100 \] \vspace{0.5cm}
