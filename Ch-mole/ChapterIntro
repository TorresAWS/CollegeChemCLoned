\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}O}{organic} chemistry is a vast subject that studies the properties of carbon-based compounds, and organic compounds are chemicals based mostly on carbon as well as hydrogen. 
On one hand, organic chemistry plays a key role in the understanding of the functioning and composition of living cells. On the other hand, many products of industrial organic chemistry such as plastics, fuels, perfumes, or prescription drugs are an accepted part of our everyday lives. These types of compounds have common organic properties, from their smells to their powerful action. Key organic chemistry concepts are the naming of organic compounds and the properties of functional groups that give unique properties to molecules such as caffeine or even addictive drugs such as cocaine.
