The molar mass is used to convert moles to grams or grams to mol. For example, the molar mass of water is $18 g/mol$. This means:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   1 \text{mole of \ce{H2O}}=18 \text{g of \ce{H2O}}   } 
\end{equation*}
that is the same as
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   \frac{\text{1 mole of \ce{H2O} }}{ \text{18 grams of } \ce{H2O}}\ \text{ or  } \frac{ \text{18 grams of }\ce{H2O} }{\text{1 mole of \ce{H2O}}}\     }
\end{equation*}
