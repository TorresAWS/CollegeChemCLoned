Chemical reactions contain molecules, which are made of atoms. Some chemical reactions are balanced, and others need to be balanced. To identify a balanced reaction, you should use the stoichiometric coefficients and the indexes in the molecular formulas to break down the reactants and products into atoms. In a balanced chemical reaction, the atoms of reactants should be the same as the atoms of the products. Consider the following reaction, \\
\begin{center}\ce{2Mg(s) + O2(g) -> 2MgO(s)}.\end{center}
The table below shows all reactants and products in the form of atoms.

The number of Mg atoms in the reactants and products is the same and equals two. On the other hand, the number of O atoms in the reactants and products is the same, equal to two. For this reason, we say this reaction is \emph{balanced}.\\
Now consider the following reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{C(s) + O2(g) -> CO(g)},\end{center}
The number of C atoms in the reactants and products is the same and equals one. In contrast, the number of O atoms in the reactants and products differ, and for this reason, we say this reaction is \emph{not balanced}.
