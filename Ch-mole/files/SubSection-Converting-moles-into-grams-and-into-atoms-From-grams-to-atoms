In the previous sections, we covered how to convert grams to moles, moles to molecules, or molecules to atoms. You can follow the diagram below to switch from one of these properties (atoms, molecules, moles, grams) to another.
For example, if you want to convert grams into moles, you will only need one step and you will only have to use a single property: the molar mass. Differently, if you need to convert grams into molecules you will have to use two different steps and use two different properties: the molar mass and Avogadro's number.
