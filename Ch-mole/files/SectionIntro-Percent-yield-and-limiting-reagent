Often, reactions do not fully proceed to completion. Fewer amounts of products are obtained when a specific quantity of a chemical is expected from a reaction. The percent yield tells how much of the final chemical is produced. The larger the yield the larger the amount of products generated and therefore, less waste is generated. This section will cover the very important idea of percent yield.
