Similarly, when we measure substances in a chemistry lab we measure them by the mole. This chapter will introduce the idea of mole and you will learn how to relate moles of a chemical to mass using a property called the molecular mass. This chapter also introduces chemical reactions.

In this chapter you will learn how to balance those equations in order to predict the amount of chemicals produced.
