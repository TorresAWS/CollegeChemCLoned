\item[\docfilehook{Molar mass of a chemical}{}] 
Chemicals are made of atoms, and each atom has an specific atomic weight (AW) listed in the periodic table. For example, the atomic weight of Na is 23 grams whereas the atomic weight of Cl is 35 g. The weight of all the atoms of a molecule is called the molecular weight (we call this also molar weight or MW). For example, the molecular weight of NaCl is 58 g, as the weight of Na and Cl is 23 and 35g. Another example would be water, \ce{H2O} with a molecular weight of 18g--as the atomic weight of H and O is 1 and 16 g, respectively, and the molecule has two H atoms. The units for molecular weight is $\frac{g}{mol}$, also written as $g/mol$. In order to compute the molar mass of a molecule you need to break down the molecule into atoms using the coefficients in the formula. For example, the formula for vinegar is \ce{C2H4O2} that means a vinegar molecule contains 2C, 4H and 2O atoms. If you add the atomic masses of 2C, 4H and 2O you will get $60g/mol$. If the chemical formula has a parenthesis, you need to open up the parenthesis to calculate the total number of atoms. As an example, \ce{Ca(NO3)2} contains 1Ca, 2N, and 6O, and its molar mass is $164.09g/mol$.
