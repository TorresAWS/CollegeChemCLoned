 We want to answer the following question: we have 6 moles of Mg (AW=$24g/mol$) and we want to calculate the mass of MgO(MW=$40g/mol$) produced. The importance of this type of calculation is based on the fact that in a chemistry laboratory chemicals are normally weighted in grams. To answer this example, we will start with the grams of Mg and convert this quantity to moles of Mg using the atomic mass. After that, we will use the mole ratio between Mg and MgO to calculate the moles of MgO. At this point, we will finish the calculation by converting the moles of MgO into grams using its molecular weight:

\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
5\cancel{\text{ grams of }\ce{Mg}}   \times  \dfrac{1 \cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{Mg}}}{24\cancel{\text{ grams of }\ce{Mg}}}
 \times \dfrac{2\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{MgO}}}{2\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{Mg}}}
  \times  \dfrac{40\text{ grams of }\ce{MgO}}{1\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{MgO}}}\\
 =10\text{ grams of }\ce{MgO}.
\end{split}\end{equation*}
Overall, we have that 5 grams of Mg will produce 10 grams of MgO.
