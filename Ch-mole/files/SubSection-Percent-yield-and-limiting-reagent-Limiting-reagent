 Let us consider the reaction between solid carbon and molecular oxygen to produce \ce{CO2}:
\begin{center}\ce{C_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} -> CO2_{(g)} } \end{center}
This reaction should be read as \say{one mole of carbon reacts with one mole of molecular oxygen to produce one mole of carbon dioxide}. Mind that to produce one mole of \ce{CO2} you need one mole of C and one mole of molecular oxygen. Now, what would happen if you mix one mole of carbon with 0.5 moles of oxygen? In this scenario, when the 0.5 moles of oxygen are consumed the reaction will stop; half a mole of carbon dioxide will be formed and half a mole of C will remain. Differently, no oxygen will remain and the whole 0.5 moles will consume. We say that C is the excess reactant and oxygen is the limiting reactant. 
Often a reaction will be accompanied by the reagent quantities and you will have to identify the limiting reagent. This reagent will limit the amount of product formed, and hence, any stoichiometric calculation aimed to predict the amount of product formed should be based on the limiting reagent and never on the excess reagent.  Next, we will explain how to systematically identify the limiting reagent.
