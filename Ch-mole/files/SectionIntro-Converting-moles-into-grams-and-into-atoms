A standard way to measure chemicals in the lab is by weight. We can weigh different quantities and the larger the quantity the larger the weight. For a chemical, the weight of a mole is called the molar (or molecular) weight. For example, if we weigh a mole of water (\ce{H2O}) we will be weighing 18 grams of water, or if you weigh a mole of table salt (\ce{NaCl}) the scale will show 58 grams. In this section, you will learn how to calculate the molar mass of a chemical and how to use this property to convert from weight to moles (and moles to weight).
