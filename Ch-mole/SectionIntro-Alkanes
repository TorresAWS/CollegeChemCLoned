This first section will introduce organic chemistry, covering the most simple organic compounds: the alkanes. Alkanes--also called hydrocarbons--are simply made of carbon and hydrogen with all C-C bonds being single bonds. First, you will be introduced to a few organic chemicals and you will learn about a series of different organic formulas that can represent the same compound. Then, you will learn the basic naming rule of alkanes, which extend to other--more complex--organic chemicals.
