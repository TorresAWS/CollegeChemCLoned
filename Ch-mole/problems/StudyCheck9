In the synthesis of ammonia (\ce{NH3}):
\begin{center}  \ce{  3H2_{(g)}  +  N2_{(g)}  -> 2NH3_{(g)} }\end{center}
you mix 3 moles of hydrogen with 0.5 moles of nitrogen. Identify the limiting and excess reagents and indicate the moles of leftover remaining. 
\providetoggle{long}\settoggle{long}{false}\iftoggle{long}{}{\begin{flushright} \mytriangleright{dgreen}\small 
 Answer: \ce{N2} is the limiting reagent and \ce{H2} the excess. 1.5 moles of hydrogen will remain.
 \end{flushright} }
