The Wurtz reaction results from the reaction of bromomethane (\ce{CH3Br}) with sodium to produce ethylene (\ce{C2H6}) 
\begin{center}  \ce{  2CH3Br_{(g)}  +  2Na_{(s)} ->  C2H6_{(g)} + 2NaBr_{(s)}}\end{center}
How many grams of sodium are need to produce 3g of ethylene given that the yield of the reaction is 30\%.
