Mercury(II) halides can be converted into mercury (I) halides by combination with metallic mercury. Mercury(I) halides are known as mercurous halides. When chlorine is the halide, the resulting mercury salt is known as calomel:
\begin{center}  \ce{  HgCl2(s)  +  Hg(l)  ->  Hg2Cl2(s) }\end{center}
When 2 grams of mercury(II) chloride reacts to produce 2 grams of calomel, calculate the percent yield of the reaction.
