Nitriles with stannous chloride (\ce{SnCl2}) in the presence of hydrochloric acid produce an imine.

\begin{center}  \ce{ $\underset{nitrile}{\ce{CH3CN(aq)}}$ + SnCl2_{(aq)} + HCl_{(aq)} -> $\underset{imine}{\ce{CH3CHNH(aq)}}$ }\end{center}
How many moles of imine (MW=43g/mol) are produced if we react 3g of nitrile (MW=41g/mol), with 2g of stannous chloride (MW=188g/mol) and 1g of hydrochloric acid (MW=36g/mol).
