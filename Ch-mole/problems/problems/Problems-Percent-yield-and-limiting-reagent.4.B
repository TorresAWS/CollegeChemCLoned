Liquid mercury reacts with gas chlorine to produce mercury(II) choride, a white solid:
\begin{center}  \ce{  Hg(l)  +  Cl2(g)  ->  HgCl2(s)  }\end{center}
In an experiment, 5-mL of mercury (AW=200.59g/mol) with density 5g/mL, reactants with 4-g of chlorine to produce 6g of \ce{HgCl2}. What is the percent yield of the reaction.
