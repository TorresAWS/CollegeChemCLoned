\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
In the synthesis of ammonia (\ce{NH3}):
\begin{center}  \ce{ $\underset{\text{2 moles}}{\ce{3H2(g)}}$ + $\underset{\text{2 moles}}{\ce{N2(g)}}$ -> 2NH3(g) }\end{center}
you mix 2 moles of hydrogen with 2 moles of nitrogen. Identify the limiting and excess reagents and indicate the moles of leftover remaining.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We will choose one of the reagents, for example the two moles of hydrogen, and calculate the amount of nitrogen needed to react with this amount of oxygen:
\begin{equation*}
2\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{H2}} \times \dfrac{\text{1 moles of }\ce{N2}}{3\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{H2}}}=0.66\text{ moles of }\ce{N2}.
\end{equation*}
Therefore, to react with 2 moles of hydrogen we need 0.66 moles of nitrogen, and we have 2 moles of nitrogen. This means we have more nitrogen than what we need and hence, nitrogen is the excess reagent and hydrogen the limiting reagent. As we need 0.66 moles of nitrogen and we have 2 moles, 1.33 moles of nitrogen will remain.
