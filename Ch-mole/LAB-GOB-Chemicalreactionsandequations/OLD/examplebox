\begin{example}{Example}

\begin{it} A solution is divided into three samples and each sample is tested using a different indicator, each one with a different equivalence point.\\
- Indicator A is colorless for pH values lower than 10 and turns pink for a pH greater than 10.\\
- Indicator B is blue up to pH 3, then it turns colorless.\\
- Indicator C is colorless for a pH lower than 6, when it turns red. The red color changes to yellow between pH 9 and pH 10, and stays yellow for higher pH values.\\
Estimate the pH range for the solution if the three samples are colorless.
\end{it}
\Sepline
\begin{bf}Answer\end{bf}: Indicator A tells that the solution's pH is lower than 10. Therefore, the range must be 0 < pH < 10.\\
Indicator B shows that the solution's pH is greater than 3 (3 to 14). This information, combined with that of indicator A, narrows the pH range to 3 < pH < 10.\\
Indicator C tells that the solution's pH is lower than 5. The final range is 3 < pH < 5.
