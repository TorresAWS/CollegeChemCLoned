\item[\docfilehook{Grams to moles in a reaction}{}] 
If we want to calculate the grams of MgO produced from 3 moles of Mg, we will start with the moles of Mg and use a conversion factor that relates moles of Mg and moles of MgO, locating the moles of Mg on the bottom:
\begin{equation*}
3\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{Mg}} \times \dfrac{\text{2 moles of }\ce{MgO}}{2\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{Mg}}}=3\text{ moles of }\ce{MgO}.
\end{equation*}
Now we aim to calculate the number of MgO moles produced from 5 grams of Mg (AW=$24g/mol$). This times, we will have first to convert the grams of Mg into moles to then use the mole ration between Mg and MgO:
\begin{equation*}
5\cancel{\text{ g of }\ce{Mg}}   \times  \dfrac{1 \cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{Mg}}}{24\cancel{\text{ g of }\ce{Mg}}}
 \times \dfrac{\text{2 moles of }\ce{MgO}}{2\cancel{\text{ moles of }\ce{Mg}}}=0.21\text{ moles of }\ce{MgO}.
\end{equation*}
