Often, reactions do not fully proceed to completion. Fewer amounts of products are obtained when a specific quantity of a chemical is expected from a reaction. The percent yield tells how much of the final chemical is produced. The larger the yield the larger the amount of products generated and therefore, the less waste is generated. At the same time, when mixing two reactants sometimes leftovers remain. In other words, sometimes there is a reagent that limits the reaction and an excess reagent. This section will cover the very important ideas of percent yield and limiting (or excess) reagent.
