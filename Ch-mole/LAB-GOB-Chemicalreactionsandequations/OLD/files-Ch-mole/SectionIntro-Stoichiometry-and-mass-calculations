In the previous section, you learned how to balance a chemical reaction. In order to do this, you had to find the stoichiometric coefficients that balance the atoms of the reactant and products. In this new section we will learn how to use those coefficients to predict the amount of product formed. You will also learn how to predict the amount of reactant needed to react with another reactant. We will use the reaction between Mg and oxygen:
\begin{center}\ce{2Mg(s) + O2(g) -> 2MgO(s)}\end{center}
in which two moles of Mg and one mole of \ce{O2} produce two moles of \ce{MgO}. We will refer to this reaction in the following.
