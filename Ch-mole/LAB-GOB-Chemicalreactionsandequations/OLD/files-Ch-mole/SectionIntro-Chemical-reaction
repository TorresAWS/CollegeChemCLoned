When we eat we burn food with molecular oxygen (\ce{O2}) to produce carbon dioxide and water. Similarly, when we start the engine of the car to go to work, gasoline burns to produce the same chemicals: \ce{CO2} and \ce{H2O}. These are two examples of chemical reactions, but there are many other examples. Nitrogen from the air reacts with hydrogen to produce ammonia, a common chemical used in the production of fertilizers. This section covers the basic of chemical reactions. You will learn how to balance reaction and how classify reactions.
