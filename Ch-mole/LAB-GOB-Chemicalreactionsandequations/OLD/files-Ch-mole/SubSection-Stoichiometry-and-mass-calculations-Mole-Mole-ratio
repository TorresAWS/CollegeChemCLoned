\item[\docfilehook{Mole-Mole ratio}{}] 
Chemical reaction can be expressed in the form of conversion factors. 
For example, the mole ratio between Mg (a reactant) and \ce{O2} (another reactant) and between Mg and \ce{MgO} is:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   \frac{\text{2 moles of Mg}}{\text{1 moles of } \ce{O2}}\ \text{ or  } \frac{ \text{1 moles of } \ce{O2}}{ \text{2 moles of Mg}}\ \text{ and }\: \frac{\text{2 moles of Mg}}{\text{2 moles of } \ce{MgO}}\ \text{ or  } \frac{ \text{2 moles of } \ce{MgO}}{ \text{2 moles of Mg}}\   }
\end{equation*}
Finally, the mole ratio between \ce{O2} and \ce{MgO} is:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   \frac{\text{1 moles of }\ce{O2}}{\text{2 moles of } \ce{MgO}}\ \text{ or  } \frac{ \text{2 moles of } \ce{MgO}}{ \text{1 moles of }\ce{O2}}\   }
\end{equation*}
Mole ratios are used, for example, to transform the amount of reactant into product.
