Some of the terms you use in your everyday life refer to a number. For example, you buy a pair of socks--two socks--or you buy a dozen of eggs from the grocery store--twelve eggs--and sometimes you buy a case of beers--24 cans. 
In a chemistry laboratory we normally do not weight small numbers of molecules of a chemical. In chemistry, molecules are counted by the mole, and the term mole--abbreviated as mol--refers to the$6.022\times 10^{23}$ number. For example, a mol of CO molecules contains $6.022\times 10^{23}$ molecules of CO, and a mol of water molecules contains $6.022\times 10^{23}$ molecules of water. This is because the word mole means the number $6.022\times 10^{23}$, similarly as  the word pair means the number two. The number $6.022\times 10^{23}$ is called Avogadro's number, about Amedeo Avogadro, the Italian physicists who coined the term. 
In chemistry labs, chemicals are often measured by weight. In this section we will show how to convert moles into weight--into grams--by using a property called the molecular weight. Finally, mind that the term mol and molecule even if they look similar they are not. Molecule refers to a combination of atoms and mole refers to a large number of molecules. As a note, the abbreviation of mole is mol, and for example we will say seven mol of \ce{H2O}.
