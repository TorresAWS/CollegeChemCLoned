Amino acids have acid-base character and that means one can modify its charge by modifying the PH. There is a specific PH value at which an AA is neutral. This is called the isoelectronic point (IP) of an Amino acid. For PH value above this point the AA will have negative charge (will be in the form of a conjugate base) and for PH values below this point the AA will have positive charge as the AA will be in a conjugate acid form. For example, the IP of Alanine is 6.1. This means that for PH lower than 6.1 the AA will have positive charge and will be in the form of a conjugate acid:
\begin{center}\ce{$\textcolor{blue}{\underset{\text{Base}}{\chemfig{C([:0]-C(=[:30]O)(-[:-30]O^{-}))([:180]-H_{3}N^{+})([:90]-CH_{3})([:-90]-H)}}}$ + $\textcolor{red}{\underset{\text{Acid}}{\ce{H2O}}}$  ->[PH=3] $\textcolor{red}{\underset{\text{Conjugate Acid}}{\chemfig{C([:0]-C(=[:30]O)(-[:-30]OH))([:180]-H_{3}N^{+})([:90]-CH_{3})([:-90]-H)}}}$ + $\textcolor{blue}{\underset{\text{Conjugate Base}}{\ce{OH^-_{(Aq)}}}}$}\end{center}
Differently, if the PH is above 6.1 the AA will have negative charge as the medium will be basic:
\begin{center}\ce{$\textcolor{blue}{\underset{\text{Acid}}{\chemfig{C([:0]-C(=[:30]O)(-[:-30]O^{-}))([:180]-H_{3}N^{+})([:90]-CH_{3})([:-90]-H)}}}$ + $\textcolor{red}{\underset{\text{Base}}{\ce{H2O}}}$  ->[PH=9] $\textcolor{red}{\underset{\text{Conjugate Base}}{\chemfig{C([:0]-C(=[:30]O)(-[:-30]O^{-}))([:180]-H_{2}N)([:90]-CH_{3})([:-90]-H)}}}$ + $\textcolor{blue}{\underset{\text{Conjugate Acid}}{\ce{OH^-_{(Aq)}}}}$}\end{center}
Finally, at the isoelectronic point the AA will be neutral.
