Nucleic acids are long polymers of a unit called nucleotide connected by means of a bond called phosphodiester. There are tow different types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. The term DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, whereas the term RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. A nucleotide ies made of a phosphate acid and a nucleoside, and at the same time a nucleoside is made of a sugar and a base. This section cover the properties of nucleic acids.
