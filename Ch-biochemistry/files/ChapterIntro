\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}B}{iochemistry} applied the principles of chemistry to organic molecules found in living systems. In particular it covers the properties of biomolecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, perhaps less known biomolecules. You can find carbohydrates in pasta, bread or rice and they give your body quick energy. These molecules are in essence biological alcohols, which contain numerous \chemfig{-[:0,1]OH} groups. Lipids on the other hand are often referred as fats or oils. Cholesterol is for example a lipid found in eggs or milk. The purpose of lipids is to store energy and insulate organs. Proteins have numerous functions in the body such as building muscle or transport oxygen in the blood. Perhaps more importantly is to know what are they made off: amino acids. Finally, if you are not familiar with the term nucleic acids, perhaps you recognize the term DNA. Nucleic acids are large molecules that contains the information for cellular growth and reproduction. Over all, this chapter will briefly cover the structure and composition of these important molecules of life.
