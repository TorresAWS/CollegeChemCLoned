The simples sugars are called monosaccharides and their name ends in \emph{ose} like in gluc\emph{ose}. These sugars are made of C, O and H and contain a few functional groups that you should be familiar with. They contain alcohol groups and either and aldehyde (\chemfig{R-C(=[:90]O)-H} ) or a ketone (\chemfig{R-C(=[:90]O)-R'}) group in the carbon number one. Depending on the number of carbons, monosaccharides can be classifies in triose, tetrose, pentose, or hexose. Here a few examples:
