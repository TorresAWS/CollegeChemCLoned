This new section covers the chemical properties of proteins, which are polymers amino acids. Amino acids are molecules with both an amino (\ce{NH2}) and a carboxylic acid group (\ce{COOH}). Amino acids have also a side chain (R)--this is a organic group different than amino or acid group. Side chains give amino acids acid-base hydrophilic-hydrophobic properties and properties. Amino acids bond together by means of a peptide amide bond producing small peptides or large proteins.
