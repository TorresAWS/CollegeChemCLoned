Some fats such as olive oil are liquid at room temperature. Other such as butter or lard are solid at room temperature. Liquid fats have low melting point so that they are already melted in a liquid form at room temperature. Solid fats have in general larger melting point and hence at room temperature they preserve its solid form. Two different factors affect the melting point of a fat. The first factor is the number of carbons. The larger the number of carbons the higher melting point and hence the fat will most likely be solid at room temperature. 
For example, lauric acic, found in coconut oil, has 12 carbon atoms and a boiling point of  44$^{\circ}$C. Palmitic acid, an oil found in palm, on the other hand has 16 carbon atoms and its boiling point would be therefore higher (63$^{\circ}$C).

The second factor is the presence of double bonds--remember these are called unsaturations. Double bonds decrease the melting point. For example, stearic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid--with no double bonds--with 18 carbons and a melting point of 69$^{\circ}$C. On the other hand, linoleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid with the same 18 carbons but a lower melting point of -5$^{\circ}$C. Due to the presence of a single unsaturation the melting point is highly reduced and hence linoleic acid will be liquid at room temperature whereas stearic acid will be a solid.
