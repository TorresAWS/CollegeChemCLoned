At this point we saw tow different sugars part of RNA and DNA. We also saw some bases that also are part of the two different nucleic acids. Still, DNA and RNA are complex molecules that also contain a third element: a phosphate unit. Phosphate results from phosphoric acid: \ce{H2PO4} after removing two hydrogens:
