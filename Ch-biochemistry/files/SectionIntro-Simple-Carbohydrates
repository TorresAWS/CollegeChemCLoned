This first section introduces one of the most important biomolecules: the carbohydrates. If you think about rice, bread, and even fruits, they all contain carbohydrates as their main ingredients. This section cover the rules for their naming of single carbohydrates, called monosaccharides, and will show you how to identify these common molecules in two different forms: a line structure and a cycle, the later called Haworth structure, named after Sir Norman Haworth, a famous english biochemist. Finally carbohydrates can form dimer and polymers and these more complex molecules will also be addressed in this section.
