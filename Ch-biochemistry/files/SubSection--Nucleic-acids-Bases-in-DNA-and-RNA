Nucleic acids contain a sugar, and also contain a base. Remember that bases are chemicals that produce hydroxyls in water. There are tow different types of nucleic bases: purine bases and pyrimidine bases. At the same time, there are three pyrimidine bases: Cytosine, Thymine, and Uracil. There are two purine bases: Adenine and Guanine. Some of these bases can only be found as part of DNA such as thymine, whereas others can be found only in RNA such as Uracil. Other nucleic bases can be found either on DNA or on RNA. An example of the later is Cytosine. Because of the complex name of these bases often times we refer to them by the first letter. For example, Uracil is also referred as U.
