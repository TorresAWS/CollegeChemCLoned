Disaccharaides are the result of the connection between two monosaccharides at a specific location of the molecule. Depending on the location of the connection and the orientation of the connection, the disaccharide would be easy or impossible to digest. Is is important to number the carbons in each monosaccharide in order to be able to identify the atoms involved in the connection. Here is an example of a monosaccharide:
\begin{center}\chemname{\chemfig[][scale=1]{HO-[:-90,0.8,2]?[b]-[:-30,1.3](-[:90,0.8]OH)-[0,1.3](-[:-90,0.8]OH)-[:30,1.3](-[:-90,0.8]-[:0,0.8]\textcolor{orange}{O}-[:0,0.8]-[:90,0.8]?[a]-[:-30,1.3](-[:90,0.8]OH)-[0,1.3](-[:-90,0.8]OH)-[:30,1.3](-[:90,0.8]\textcolor{orange}{OH})-[:150,1.2]\textcolor{red}{O}-[4, 1.3]?[a](-[:90, 1.0]-[:160, 0.7]OH))-[:150,1.2]\textcolor{red}{O}-[4, 1.3]?[b](-[:90, 1.0]-[:160, 0.7]OH)}  }{\textcolor{blue}{$\beta$-maltose}}\end{center}
In order to number the chain we start by the -O- atom. This atoms would be zero. After that you continue numbering clockwise. The results is:
\begin{center}\chemfig[][scale=1]{HO-[:-90,1.2,2](!\nobond\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{purple}{4}})?[b]-[:-30,1.3](!\nobond\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{purple}{3}})(-[:90,0.8]OH)-[0,1.3](!\nobond\chemabove[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{purple}{2}})(-[:-90,0.8]OH)-[:30,1.3](!\nobond\chembelow[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{purple}{1}})(-[:90,0.8]\textcolor{orange}{OH})-[:150,1.2]\textcolor{red}{O}-[4, 1.3]\chemabove[0.05ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{purple}{5}}?[b](-[:90, 1.0](!\nobond\chemabove[1ex]{}{\tiny \textcolor{purple}{6}})-[:160, 0.7]OH)}\end{center}
