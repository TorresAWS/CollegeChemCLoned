This section covers the chemical properties and structure of lipids. These biomolecules are often referred as fats as they are insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvents. Think about oil, butter or even cholesterol. All these are different types of lipids with distinct structure. One one hand, oil and butter contain fatty acids, which are organic acids--carboxylic acids--with a carboxylic group connected to a very long zigzag hydrocarbon chain. On the other hand, cholesterol is a lipid that do not contain fatty acids. The structure of cholesterol results from an steroid nucleus made of three cyclohexane and a cyclopentane fused together. Perhaps less known fats are waxes and triacylglicerols. Both result from the reaction of fatty acids and alcohols. We will briefly cover the structure of those lipids as well. The following diagrams gives the classification for the different kinds of lipids.
