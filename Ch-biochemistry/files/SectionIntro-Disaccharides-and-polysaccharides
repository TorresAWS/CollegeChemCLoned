This next section covers the properties of the di and polysaccharides. These are more complex saccharides made of two of more units of sugar. At the same time, these form the most common carbs. For example, sugar cane is a disaccharides, that is, contains two monosaccharides units. Differently, the starch in potatoes is a polysaccharide, made of numerous saccharides units, and cellulose is a structural polysaccharide used by plants. All this complex saccharides have very different properties and for example humans can easily digest sugar cane and starch but not cellulose. The difference is in the way the monosaccharides are connected among themselves by means of a connection names glycosidic bond.
