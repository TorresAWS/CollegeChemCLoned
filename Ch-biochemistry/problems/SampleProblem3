\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Classify the following haworth monosaccharide as $\alpha$ or $\beta$ :
\begin{center}\chemfig{HO-[2,0.8,2]?-[:-30,1.3](-[:90,0.8]OH)-[0,1.3](-[:-90,0.8]OH)-[:30,1.3](-[:-90,0.8]\textcolor{orange}{OH})-[:150,1.2]\textcolor{red}{O}-[4, 1.3]?(-[:90, 1.0]-[:160, 0.7]OH)}\end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
As the second OH group after the -O- in the cycle points down, it will be $\alpha$.
