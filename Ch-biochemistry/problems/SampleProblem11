\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Classify the following AA as acidic, basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular*}{1\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}>{\centering}m{0.3\textwidth}>{\centering}m{0.3\textwidth}>{\centering}m{0.2\textwidth}}
\setatomsep{2.5em}\lysin
&
\setatomsep{2.5em}\proline
\tabularnewline\addlinespace
\end{tabular*}\end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
They key to classify the different AA is on its side chain. The AA on the left has a nonpolar side chain made of C and H and hence it will hydrophobic. The AA on the right has a polar side chain with N and at the same time a basic side chain. This AA will be hydrophilic and at the same time basic.\\
