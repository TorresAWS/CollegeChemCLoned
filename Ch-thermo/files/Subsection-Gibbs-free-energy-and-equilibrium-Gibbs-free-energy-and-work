The Gibbs free-energy of a reaction gives an estimate of the thermodynamic feasibility of a reaction. In other words, if Gibbs free-energy predicts that a reaction will not likely happen there is no need to invest time in energy trying to make a reaction work. The change in Gibbs free-energy, as its name indicates, also gives insight into the maximum amount of work--in particular nonexpansive work--that can be extracted from a system (chemical reaction, an engine, etc). More precisely, $\Delta G$ represents the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system a fixed pressure and temperature conditions. It represents the amount of useful energy to do work that a system has. When this value is positive, it represents the amount of work that needs to be put into the system in order to make the process work:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ w\leq \Delta G_R 	}\label{\chapterlabel:equation13}
\end{equation}
Gibbs free energy also tells about how efficient the energy conversion is. Let us analyze the energy contained in the battery of a cell phone. We could use this energy to produce work and power the cell phone. However, every electricity flow implies a loss of heat due to friction, and hence all energy contained in the battery could only be used if the electricity flow is very very small and under these conditions, the battery will not be able to do real work. Hence, energy can only fully used to do work in a hypothetical scenario in which the process works reversibly. However, all real processes are irreversibly and energy will always be lost. For such reason, it will take more energy to charge a battery than the energy given by the battery, as an irreversible electric flow implies energy loss. In other words, energy irreversibly used degrades on its use.
