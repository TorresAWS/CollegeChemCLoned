Thermodynamics studies states of equilibrium, whereas chemical kinetics studies the rate at which chemical reactions reach equilibrium. Gibbs free energy $\Delta G$ is a thermodynamic function used to describe how a system spontaneously approaches equilibrium. During a spontaneous chemical reaction, $\Delta G$ decreases until reaching a minimum value when the reaction reaches equilibrium. Differently, $\Delta G^{\circ}$--defined in standard pressure conditions--has a fixed value that does not change during a reaction.
Still, this function depends on temperature and pressure and until now we did not address how the pressure conditions affect the equilibrium.
