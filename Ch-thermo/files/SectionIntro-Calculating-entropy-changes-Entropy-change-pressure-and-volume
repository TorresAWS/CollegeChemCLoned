The following formula can be used to calculate the entropy change of an ideal gas when its pressure and volume change  at constant temperature.  
 \begin{equation}
\boxed{  \Delta S=nR\ln \Big(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\Big)+nR\ln \Big(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\Big)	}\label{\chapterlabel:equation13}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\Delta S$   is the entropy change
 \item $n $   is the number of moles
 \item $R $   is the constant of the gases in energy units (8.314J/molK)
 \item $P_1$  and $V_1$ is the initial pressure and volume
 \item $P_2$  and $V_2$ is the final pressure and volume
\end{where}
