Enthalpies are relative properties and when we compute the formation energy of water we need the formation energy of oxygen and oxygen gas. These two values are zero and are assumed the reference. Entropies are absolute values. The term absolute refers to the absolute scale of temperatures where the lowest value is well defined and equal to zero. Similarly, there is the lowest value for entropy two and we will discuss this value when dealing with the third law of thermodynamics.
