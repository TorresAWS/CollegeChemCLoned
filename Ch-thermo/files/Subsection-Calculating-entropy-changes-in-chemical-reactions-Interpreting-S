If the entropy change of a reaction is positive we will say that the reaction produces entropy. Similarly, if the entropy change of a reaction is negative we will say that the reaction consumes entropy. An analog trend can be found for the change of enthalpy--remember the enthalpy of the heat measured at constant pressure conditions--so if the enthalpy change of a reaction is positive we say the reaction is endothermic and consumes heat, whereas a negative enthalpy change for a reaction means the reaction produces heat.
