Thermodynamics studies systems involving heat transfer such as a hot cup of coffee cooling down in a room or a chemical reaction happening at a beaker on a lab bench. 
The system just means the problems we are dealing with, for example, the cup of coffee or the beaker. However, every system has its surroundings. For example, the cup of coffee is surrounded by air and the beaker is in contact with the lab bench.
The surroundings of a system represent everything else but the system and in general tend to be as important as the system, in particular when understanding the changes of entropy during a spontaneous change. Both the system and its surroundings are called the universe, which is an isolated system. If we study how a system loses heat or a reaction consumes entropy it is convenient to think about where the heat goes or where the entropy lost is coming from.
