A mathematical or molecular level description of entropy was suggested by Ludwig Boltzmann. Entropy depends on the number of energetically equivalent microstates, that is, the number of different ways in which a system existing in a given state can be arranged. The Boltzmann formula for entropy is:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{  S=k_B ln(W)	}\label{\chapterlabel:equation1}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $S$   is the entropy of a system
 \item $k_B$   is the Boltzmann constant ($1.381\times 10^{23}$ J/K)
% \item $N$  is the number of particles in the system
%  \item $X$  is the number of possible arrangements  
  \item $W$  is the number of  microstates 
\end{where}
 The Boltzmann's constant results from statistical thermodynamics--probabilistic thermodynamics--being related to the ideal gas constant through $R=N_A\cdot k_B$, with $N_A$ Avogadro's number. At the same time, $W$ is the number of microstates of the system that is the number of different ways in which the particles of a system can be differently arranged for a given energy. Hence the molecular-level description of entropy is closely related to probability and we may imagine that the system exists in numerous microstates of short existence. When measuring the system we are indeed measuring a time average of the properties of the different microstates. The larger the number of microstates--the more ways a particular state can be achieved--the most probable the configuration--the greater is the likelihood of finding that state. 

Let us analyze an example to describe the meaning of microstate and the use of Boltzmann entropy.
Imagine a box with two identical ideal-gas particles and two compartments. In each compartment, the particles can occupy four different locations, with two locations on the top part of the compartment and two locations on the bottom part. Each of the particle arrangements would be a microstate. Let us now analyze the number of equivalent microstates when the box is closed so that the particles cannot jump into the other compartment. Below are all possible microstates for this scenario:

      The number of different arrangements represented above is $X$=6, and the entropy associated with this system would be $k_B ln(6)$ that is $2.5\times 10^{23}$ J/K.
Now, if we open the separation between the two compartments so that the molecules can freely move from one compartment to the other, the number of microstates increases considerably. We would have three different scenarios: (1) the scenario in which the particles stay in the left compartment, (2) the scenario in which the particles stay in the right compartment, (3) the scenario in which the particles are spread between both compartments. What situation do you think is more feasible?
In particular, we have a set of six configurations in which both particles populate the left compartment and a set of six configurations in which both particles populate the right compartment. The entropy for these two scenarios is $k_B ln(6)$. We would also have a set of 16 configurations in which each particle populates a different compartment. The entropy for these two scenarios is $k_B ln(16)$.  The Boltzmann formula suggests that the most feasible scenario, the scenario with higher entropy, corresponds to the spreading of particles between both compartments.As we will see along the chapter, the situation in which each particle populates a different compartment has larger entropy and hence it would be the most probable scenario.

The calculation of different microstates come from the close study of the situation in hand. In the scenario described above, we had two compartments and four possible locations. Each molecule had a single state or orientation. One can also find the case that the molecules have several states. For example, \ce{CO} molecules can be found in two different orientations when an external field is applied. In the case of multiple molecular arrangements it is convenient to use the formula below:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{  W=A^N	}\label{\chapterlabel:equation9}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $A$   is the number of molecular states
% \item $N$  is the number of particles in the system
  \item $W$  is the number of  microstates 
\end{where}
For example for the scenario of two molecules with two different orientations we will have $2^2$ microstates.      

The type of probability related to the number of configurations in space is called \emph{positional probability} and the entropy resulting from positional probability is called \emph{positional entropy}. Positional probability can be used to understand phenomena such as the change of state of the dissolution of solids in liquids. When a solid becomes liquid the number of possible microstates increases and hence entropy increases as well. Similarly, when dissolving a solute into a liquid, the number of microstates and entropy increases.
However, computing the number of microstates to estimate positional entropy is not practical for large systems with numerous configurations. The number of microstates increases exponentially with the number of particles to the point that, for large systems, is not practical to compute entropy using Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation1}.
