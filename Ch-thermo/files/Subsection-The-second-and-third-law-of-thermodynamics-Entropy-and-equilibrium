A system without tendency to change is a system in static equilibrium. A system in dynamic equilibrium has the same tendency to change through forward or backwards evolution. For example, a reaction reaches chemical equilibrium when the mixtures of reactants and products reached a point in which the forward reaction and the backwards reaction have the same speed. A system reaches thermal equilibrium when it releases and gains heat with its surroundings at the same speed. A system reaches mechanical equilibrium--a gas in a piston--when it contracts and expands at the same speed. When an isolated system has reached equilibrium the entropy of the universe does not change:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\boxed{  \Delta S_{univ}=0    }
\end{split}\end{equation} 
%At the same time when the overall change of entropy of the universe is null the system will be in equilibrium. We will leave the explanation of the second law of thermodynamics here, involving spontaneity, and we will address more deeply the assessment of spontaneity at the end of this chapter.
