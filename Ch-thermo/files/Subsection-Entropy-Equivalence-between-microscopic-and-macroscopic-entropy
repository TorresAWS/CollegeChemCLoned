We have addressed two different definitions of entropy, a macroscopic definition based on heat and a microscopic definition based on configurations. Each description is based in a different formula. The macroscopic description of entropy is based on the Clausius' formula whereas the microscopic description is based on Boltzmann's formula. Here we will explain why both descriptions are indeed equivalent.
First, both types of entropies are state functions, macroscopic entropy depends on the initial and final temperature, volume or pressure and not the path taken to reach the final state. Similarly, the microscopic entropy depends on the initial and final microstates, not the transition between both states. Macroscopic entropy is extensive and depends on the size of the system, and microscopic entropy is extensive as well as the larger the system the more configurations would be. Finally, when the size of a system increases the energy levels that its particle occupies become more packed and the particles are able to distribute among these states. At low temperatures all particles occupy only the lowest level energy level and hence there is only one configuration or micro state for the system, being its entropy zero.
