This section covers the calculation and estimation of the entropy change of a reaction. Entropies are well as enthalpies are tabulated and one can compute the entropy change of a reaction by using the tabulated molar entropies. On the other hand it is very convenient to be able to estimate the just the sign of the entropy change of a reaction. Here we will provide a set of general rules to do this.
