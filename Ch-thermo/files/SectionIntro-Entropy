Entropy, represented with an $S$, refers to the spreading of energy and composition of a system. Energy and matter have the tendency to spread and this spreading is represented by entropy. Think about a glass full of hot water and how water is going to spontaneously cool down, as the energy spreads between the glass and its environment. Similarly, think about a gas container opened in vacuum, and how gas molecules spontaneously will leave the container and spread out. Overall, entropy has a macroscopic and microscopic description, with these two descriptions converging into a cohesive concept.
