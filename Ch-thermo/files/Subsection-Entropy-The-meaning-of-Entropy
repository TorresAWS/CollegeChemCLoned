Entropy is represented with the letter $S$. Qualitatively, it is a measure of the spreading in space of the energy of a system, or simply the system. For example, in a glass full of hot water, the energy is concentrated in the glass as the water molecules initially have high thermal energy. With time, the system evolves naturally so that heat spreads between the room and the container. The initial state (glass with hot water) has lower entropy than the final state (glass with thermalized water). Another example, think about a concentrated solution separated from a more diluted system by means of a membrane. Initially, the entropy of the system is low, as one side of the container has a high density of molecules whereas the other side has a lower density. As the molecules diffuse and the concentration equalizes. In this case, the entropy of the initial state (a concentrated and a diluted solution) is lower than the entropy of the final system (two solutions of equal concentration). These two examples represent how energy and matter spread as entropy increases in spontaneous processes.
On one hand, entropy, just like enthalpy, is a \emph{state function} in thermodynamics which means that the change of entropy of a system when going from an initial into a final state is independent of the path taken to arrive from the initial into the final state. On the other hand, entropy is an \emph{extensive property} that depends on the size of the system and for example the entropy change when heating 2 moles of gas is larger than when heating 1 mole of gas.
