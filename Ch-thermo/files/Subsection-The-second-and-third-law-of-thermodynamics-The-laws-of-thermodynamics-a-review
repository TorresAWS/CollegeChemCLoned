There are four laws of thermodynamics. The zeroth law deals with heat transfer and says that two systems in thermal equilibrium are also in thermal equilibrium with a third system equilibrated with one of them. On the other hand, the first law of thermodynamics deals with internal energy, claiming that the internal energy of a system is conserved. The second law deals with entropy claiming that the entropy of the universe can only increase. Finally, the last and third law of thermodynamics deals with the scale of entropies defining the minimum entropy value.
