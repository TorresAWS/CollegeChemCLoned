The standard molar entropy of a substance is the absolute entropy of one more substance at 1 atm. Entropies are absolute properties in contrast to other relative thermodynamic functions like the enthalpy in which a set of molecular states act as a reference. A few standard entropy values are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:Table-S-and-states-of-matter} at one bar and 25 $^{\circ}$C, the conventional temperature of reporting thermodynamic data. More values are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:Table-thermod-data}, at the end of the chapter. The units of molar entropy are J/molK. Molar entropies tend to be small values--as the unit joule is a small unit of energy. Finally, entropies can be positive or negative values.
