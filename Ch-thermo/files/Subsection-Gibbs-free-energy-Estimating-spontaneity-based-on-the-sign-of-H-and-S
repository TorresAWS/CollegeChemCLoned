As Gibbs free-energy depends on the enthalpy and entropy. We can estimate the sign of $\Delta G$ from the signs of $\Delta  H$ and $\Delta S$. Table \ref{tab:Table-G-sign} below show the different sign combinations.

The reasoning behind the different sign combinations is that as Gibbs free-energy is related to minus the entropy, to achieve a final negative value of $G$ we need negative enthalpy and positive entropy that would lead to a spontaneous process that consumes free-energy. In other words, exothermic processes that produce heat and processes that produce entropy are spontaneous. Differently, endothermic processes that consume heat and processes that consume entropy are nonspontaneous. For entropy and enthalpy changes with the same sign, then the spontaneity will depend on temperature. For example, to carry endothermic processes and processes that produce entropy, we would need high temperatures that help enthalpy. In the case of an exothermic process that consumes entropy, we would need low temperatures that help alleviate the entropy. For both cases, the critical temperature for spontaneity is given by:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\boxed{  T_c  = \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta S}  }
\label{\chapterlabel:equation7}
\end{split}\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $T_c$ is the critical temperature for spontaneity in Kelvins  
 \end{where}
 Mind that the units of $\Delta H$ tend to be kJ/mol, whereas the units of $\Delta S$ tend to be J/mol. Therefore, we need to remove the kilo prefix to calculate $T_c$. For example, to combine an enthalpy value of 100KJ/mol with an entropy value of 5J/mol, we would have to convert the enthalpy value into 100000J/mol.
