A spontaneous process happens naturally, without any help or external input. For example, ice spontaneously melts at room temperature, without any help. 
 Still, spontaneity happens under a certain set of conditions. For example, ice melts at room temperature but does not melt at -5$^{\circ}$C, as the process in these conditions is not spontaneous. Other spontaneous processes are the rusting of iron at room temperature, or the freezing of water below 0$^{\circ}$C.
Spontaneous processes have a natural tendency to occur. Still, this tendency might not be actualized in practice. At the same time, this natural tendency to occur is not linked in any way to the speed or rate of the process. For example, diamonds have a natural tendency to become graphite. Still, the rate of this change is so slow that in human years it does never occur.
Remember that thermodynamics addresses spontaneity whereas kinetics address the rate of occurrence of a process.
