Overall an entropy change is associated with the flow of heat. The change of entropy associated with the heat flow, at constant temperature, can be computed using the expression below, called generalized Clausius relation:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{  \Delta S=\frac{q }{T}	}\label{\chapterlabel:equation8}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\Delta S$   is the entropy change
 \item $q $   is the reversible heat transferred
 \item $T$  is the absolute temperature (in K)
\end{where}
This expression refers to $q $ that is the heat enhanced reversibly, exchanging heat in very tinny bits so that the temperature does not change significantly. The larger the heat exchanges the larger the entropy change. At the same time, a larger entropy change will be associated with the heat exchange at low temperatures than at high temperatures. The entropy change resulting from a heat flow can be referred to as \emph{thermal entropy}.
Formula \ref{\chapterlabel:equation8} is one of the ways to mathematically describe the \emph{second law of thermodynamics} that says that a system and its surroundings--an isolated system--evolve spontaneously increasing its overall entropy.
