On one hand, at fixed pressure and temperature,  the Gibbs free-energy does not change: $\Delta G_R=0$. On the other hand, at fixed pressure and temperature,  the entropy of the universe does not change: $\Delta S_{univ}=0$. 

At the same time, in equilibrium conditions,  the value of the equilibrium constant is the same as the value of the reaction ration: $Q_p=K_p$. Hence, we can relate the equilibrium constant and the standard Gibbs free-energy:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \Delta G^{\circ}_R =-RT\ln K_p	}\label{\chapterlabel:equation12}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $K_p$   the equilibrium constant in terms of pressure
 \item $\Delta G^{\circ}_R$   is the Gibbs free-energy of a reaction at standard conditions (1atm and 298K)
 \item $R$  is the constant of the gases in energy units (8.314J/mol$\cdot\text{ }$  K)
  \item $T$  is the absolute temperature
\end{where}
In other words, the value of the equilibrium constant and the standard Gibbs free-energy convey the same information. On one hand, when $\Delta G^{\circ}_R<0$ we have that $K_p>1$ and in the reactive mixture we will have more products than reactants: the reaction will happen spontaneously. On the other hand, when $\Delta G^{\circ}_R>0$ we have that $K_p<1$ and in the reactive mixture will have more reactants than products: the reaction will not happen spontaneously.
