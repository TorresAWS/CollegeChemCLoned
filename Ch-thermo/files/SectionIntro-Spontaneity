Chemical kinetics is a discipline that deals with the pace of chemical reactions by using activation energies, concentrations, and temperatures. It also deals with the different pathways of reaction. However, chemical kinetics does no provide information about the reasons why chemical reactions happen. 
Thermodynamics informs about the direction in which a chemical reaction occurs spontaneously and the reasons for this reaction to happen, without informing about the speed at which the process occurs. It uses thermodynamic functions--enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs free energies--to understand the factors that favor the spontaneity of a reaction.
Overall, kinetics and thermodynamics are complementary disciplines in chemistry as it is convenient to gain insight into the pace and spontaneity of chemical reactions.
