We have that when a system receives heat its entropy increases. At the same time, when a system receives heat its temperature increases. Therefore, there should be a relation between the temperature increase and the entropy increase. At the same time if we compress of decompress a gas at constant temperature,  its entropy also changes based on the change of volume or the change of pressure. In particular, if we apply some mechanical work to a system so its volume decreases its entropy will increase as the system has received work--mechanical energy. Mind the opposite trend here. Similarly, if a the pressure of a system increases as a result of applying an external force its entropy will also increase.
