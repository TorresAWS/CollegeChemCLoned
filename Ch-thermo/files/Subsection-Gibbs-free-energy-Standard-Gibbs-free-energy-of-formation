The Gibbs free-energy $G$ of a compound depends on temperature, pressure as well as composition, which means that for every pressure, temperature, and molarity we have a different free-energy value. Similar to the case of enthalpy, a standard state is defined in order to tabulate the free-energy values $\Delta G^{\circ}$ (see Table \ref{tab:Table-thermod-data}). The standard states of an element represent its most stable form at 1atm and 298K. In the case of solutions, the standard state corresponds to a 1 molar concentration and in the case of gases to a 1 atm pressure. Table \ref{tab:Table-G-references} list the reference state for a few elements. For example, you can find Bromine as a solid, liquid or gas. However, its natural state is liquid. That is the reason why $\Delta G^{\circ}(\ce{Br_2_{(g)}})=3$KJ/mol, whereas $\Delta G^{\circ}(\ce{Br2_{(l)}})=0$KJ/mol. In general, for metals, its natural state is solid. For non-metallic elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, its natural state is in the form of a diatomic gas molecule. For example, $\Delta G^{\circ}(\ce{H2_{(g)}})=0$KJ/mol, $\Delta G^{\circ}(\ce{N2_{(g)}})=0$KJ/mol or $\Delta G^{\circ}(\ce{O2_{(g)}})=0$KJ/mol. For the case of carbon, its natural state is graphite, $\Delta G^{\circ}(\ce{C_{graphite}_{(s)}})=0$KJ/mol. Molecules such as \ce{H2O} or \ce{NO} have standard free-energydifferent than zero. Mind that molecules are made of elements.
The establishment of a Gibbs free energy scale based on a set of reference states allows the calculation of standard Gibbs free energies of formation $\Delta G^{\circ}_f$: the Gibbs free energy of formation per mole of the formation of a compound from its elements on its most stable states.
 The values for Gibbs free energy of formation $\Delta G^{\circ}_f$ are tabulated at 25$^{\circ}$C. These values inform about the stability of the compound with respect to its elements. For example, $\Delta G^{\circ}_f$ for ammonia is -16KJ/mol, which means that ammonia is thermodynamically stable and will not decompose to produce hydrogen and nitrogen spontaneously.  Different, $\Delta G^{\circ}_f$ for \ce{NO2} is 51KJ/mol. This positive value indicates that nitrogen dioxide will spontaneously decompose into nitrogen and oxygen. Still, even when the decomposition of a chemical is favored by the laws of thermodynamics, its rate might be slow, and only kinetics can inform about the timing of the decomposition. Chemicals are called labile (nonlabile) when they decompose or react quickly (slowly).
