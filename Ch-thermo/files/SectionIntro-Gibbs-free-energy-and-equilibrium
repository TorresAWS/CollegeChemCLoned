We can use the principles of thermodynamics to study different phase transitions such as the transition between solid and liquid (melting or fusion) or liquid and gas (vaporization or boiling). These phase transitions are examples of equilibrium.
During these transitions the temperature remains constant and all energy supplied is used to convert molecules between the two equilibrated phases and not to warm up the system. For example, the boiling point of water at 1 atm is 100$^{\circ}$C and during boiling--also called vaporization--even when we continue the heating the temperature of water remains constant at 100$^{\circ}$C until all water molecules become vapor. At the same time during a phase transition the Gibbs free energy of the two phase in equilibrium are the same.
