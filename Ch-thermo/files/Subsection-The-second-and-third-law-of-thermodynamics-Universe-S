Now that we have included the surroundings in our analysis we can combine both the system and its surroundings in order to track the overall change in entropy in the universe:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\boxed{  \Delta S_{univ}=\Delta S + \Delta S_{surr}=\Delta S  -\frac{\Delta H }{T}    }
\label{\chapterlabel:equation5}
\end{split}\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\Delta S_{univ}$   is the entropy change on the universe
 \item $\Delta S $   is the entropy change on the system
  \item $\Delta H $   is the enthalpy change on the system
 \item $T$   is the absolute temperature 
 \end{where}
Overall, the \emph{second law of thermodynamics} states that spontaneous process increase the entropy of the universe. If a reaction is exothermic and heat is being released the entropy of the surroundings increase whereas the entropy of the system can increase or decrease. If this change is negative, it has to be smaller than the entropy increase of the surroundings if the process is spontaneous. If a reaction is endothermic and heat is being absorbed the entropy change of the system has to be positive enough to compensate the decrease of entropy of the surroundings if the process is spontaneous. 
\begin{itemize}[label={\faCodeFork\ }]
    \item 	\begin{bf}$\Delta S_{univ}>0$:\end{bf} The forward process or reaction is spontaneous
    \item 	\begin{bf}$\Delta S_{univ}=0$:\end{bf} The process or reaction is in equilibrium
    \item 	\begin{bf}$\Delta S_{univ}<0$:\end{bf} The forward process or reaction is not spontaneous hence the backwards is spontaneous
\end{itemize}
