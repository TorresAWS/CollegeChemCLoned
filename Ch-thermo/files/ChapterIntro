\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}I}{t} is common sense that some natural phenomena happen spontaneously in nature, without any help, in nature whereas others do not. For example, one would expect a ball on a hill to roll down instead of rolling up.  How does common sense apply in chemistry? Why some reactions happen spontaneously whereas others do not. For example, methane (\ce{CH4}) spontaneously burns with oxygen (\ce{O2}), producing carbon dioxide, and water. Differently, if we mix water and carbon dioxide, \ce{CH4} is not spontaneously produced. Thermodynamics helps make sense of spontaneity in physics and chemistry. In particular, three thermodynamic properties--enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy--are commonly used to predict different aspects of spontaneity. At the same time, spontaneity in chemistry is indeed related to equilibrium and these properties can be translated into equilibrium constants.
