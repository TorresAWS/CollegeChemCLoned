Entropy is an absolute--not relative--property. The third law of thermodynamics established the lower possible entropy value that a system can reach under certain conditions. We have that from a microscopic or molecular point of view entropy is associated with the number of molecular configurations, $W$. For a perfect crystal--a crystalline material without any defects--at the lowest possible temperature, that is the absolute zero in the Kelvin scale, 0K,  there is no molecular motion and hence the system would have only one possible configuration ($W$=1) that would lead to a null entropy ($k_B\ln 1$).

The entropy of a solid depends on the number of the number of molecules and the number of possible configurations of each molecule of the solid. For a solid with for example two molecules and with each molecule having three possible configuration we'll have $2^3$ possible microstates and the entropy will be $k_B\ln 2^3$. Given that $\ln a^b=b\ln a$ we have $3\cdot k_B\ln 2$.

Given that $\ln a^b=b\ln a$ we have $3\cdot k_B\ln 2$. For a larger sample, containing one mole of atoms, the number of microstates is very larger, in particular $2^{6.02\times 10^{23}}$. Hence the value of the entropy is $6.02\times 10^{23}\cdot k_B\ln 2=5.75 J/K$. This value is called the residual entropy of a sample, the entropy at 0K that results from positional disorder.
