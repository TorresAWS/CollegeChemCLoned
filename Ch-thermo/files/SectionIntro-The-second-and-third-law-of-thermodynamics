The second law of thermodynamics claims that any spontaneous evolution is accompanied by an increase in entropy. However, the entropy of certain common systems spontaneously decreases. For example, ice freezes below 0$^{\circ}$C going from less-ordered liquid water to more-ordered ice. At the same time, cold packs spontaneously get colder going from a high-temperature and entropy state into a low-temperature low-entropy state. In order to understand how some systems decrease their entropy spontaneously, we need to further our analysis of the system taking into account not only the system under study but also its surroundings.
