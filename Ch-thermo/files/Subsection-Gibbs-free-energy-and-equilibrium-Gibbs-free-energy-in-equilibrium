In equilibrium a system does not evolve in any direction, or it evolved back and forth in the same direction. For example in equilibrium a reaction proceed forward and backwards at the same pace. In these conditions, the total entropy of the system and universe do not change ($\Delta S_{univ}^{T,P}=0$). In these conditions the Gibbs free energy do not change either. Overall we have:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\boxed{  \Delta G^{T,P}=0} 
 \label{\chapterlabel:equation23}
\end{split}\end{equation}
