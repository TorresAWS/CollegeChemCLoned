The Gibbs free-energy is just a combination of enthalpy and entropy for a given temperature:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
    G  =  H -T  \cdot S    
\label{\chapterlabel:equation20}
\end{split}\end{equation}
Working at constant temperature, we can compute the change in Gibbs free energy as:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\boxed{  \Delta G^{T}  =  \Delta H -T \Delta S \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Gibbs free-energy}}  }
\label{\chapterlabel:equation6}
\end{split}\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\Delta G^{T}$ is the Gibbs free-energy change  at constant temperature
 \item $\Delta H$ is the enthalpy change   
 \item $\Delta S$ is the entropy change 
  \item $T$ is the temperature  
 \end{where}
Gibbs free-energy is a state function that only depends on the final and initial state and not the path followed. At the same time, Gibbs free-energy depends on temperature and pressure--we will discuss more about this at the end of the section. More importantly, the change in Gibbs free-energy is associated with the spontaneity of the process. Gibbs free-energy decreases with temperature and the decrease is sharper for gases in comparison to liquids, and at the same time, the decrease is also sharper for liquids in comparison to solids.
