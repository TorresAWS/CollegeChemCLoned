We have addressed two thermodynamic functions at this point: enthalpy and entropy. The first is associated with the energy exchange whereas the second is associated with the spreading of energy. At the same time, the second law of thermodynamics helps predicts the spontaneity of a process. Still, this second law is written in terms of two different entities, the system, and its surroundings. If we combine both the entropy and the enthalpy we obtain a new thermodynamic function associated with spontaneity, the Gibbs free-energy.
