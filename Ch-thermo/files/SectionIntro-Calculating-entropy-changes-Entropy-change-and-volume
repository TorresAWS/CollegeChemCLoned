The following formula can be used to calculate the entropy change of an ideal gas when its volume changes at constant temperature. A volume decrease will cause an entropy decrease:
 \begin{equation}
\boxed{  \Delta S=nR\ln \Big(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\Big)	}\label{\chapterlabel:equation11}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\Delta S$   is the entropy change in J/K
 \item $n $   is the number of moles
 \item $R $   is the constant of the gases in energy units (8.314J/molK)
 \item $V_1$  is the initial volume  
 \item $V_2$  is the final volume  
\end{where}
