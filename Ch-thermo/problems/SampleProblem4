Compare entropy for the following systems:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  Liquid ammonia at 25$^{\circ}$C and 1 bar and gas ammonia at 25$^{\circ}$C and 1 bar	 
\item  Liquid ammonia at 25$^{\circ}$C and 1 bar and liquid ammonia at 45$^{\circ}$C and 1 bar
\item  3 moles of an ideal gas and 5 moles of the same gas at fixed temperature and pressure
 \end{inparaenum}
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Gas ammonia has a larger entropy than liquid ammonia as gases in general tend to have larger entropy. When dealing with temperature, the higher temperature the higher entropy. Hence liquid ammonia at 45$^{\circ}$C and 1 bar will have a larger entropy than liquid ammonia at 25$^{\circ}$C and 1 bar. Finally, entropy is an extensive property and 5 moles of a gas will have larger entropy than 3 moles of the same gas.
