\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
We warm up a cup of vegetable oil in the microwave, at low power and for a long time, giving 40KJ of heat to the oil. Calculate the entropy change experienced by the oil at 30$^{\circ}$C.
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We will calculate the thermal entropy by means of Clausius' relation given that the heat is 40000J and the fixed temperature is $30+273=303$K. Remember as the oil (this is the system under study) receives heat the numerical value of heat of positive and also we need absolute temperature in Clausius' relation. We finally have that:
\[\Delta S=\frac{q }{T}=\frac{40000 }{303}=132J/K\]
As a final comment, mind that the heat exchange has happened reversibly as they point the microwave functions at a low power and for a low time.
