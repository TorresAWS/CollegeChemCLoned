The image below represents six ideal gas-molecules in a two-bulb container. The molecules are able to travel from one side to the other.

Answer the following questions: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item What is the total number of microstates in this system %3 microstates: left population, right population, mixed
\item What is the most likely arrangement of the molecules  %mixed distribution
\item What is the least likely arrangement of the molecules %left or right population
\item What is the probability of finding the system in the most likely arrangement of the molecules %$5/7\times 100$
