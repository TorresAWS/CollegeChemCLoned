Answer the following questions:
 \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item   We expand 10 moles of an ideal gas from 1L to 2L isothermally, and after that we increase its pressure from 1 atm to 5 atm. Calculate the entropy change of the gas.
\item   We compress 10 moles of an ideal gas from 1 atm to 5 atm isothermally and after we expand the gas from 1L to 2L isothermally. Calculate the entropy change of the gas.
\item   Compare the answers of the previous questions and justify its difference.

  \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  	 -76.18J/K 
\item  	 -76.18J/K 
\item  	 Same number as entropy is a state function that only depends on the initial and final state and not the path taken to get from the initial to the final state

Answer the following questions:
 \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item   A 10 moles sample of a monoatomic ideal gas ($C_v=\frac{3}{2}R$ and $C_p=\frac{5}{2}R$) is compressed from 10L to 1L at fixed pressure and during the process its temperature increases from 200K to 300K. Calculate the entropy change of the gas.
