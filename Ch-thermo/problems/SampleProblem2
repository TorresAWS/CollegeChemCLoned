The image below represents two different ideal gas-molecules in a two-bulb container. The molecules are able to travel from one side to the other.
\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[thick,scale=0.9, every node/.style={transform shape}]
\draw [green, very thick,  fill=yellow!10] (0,0) -- ++ (-1,0) arc (0:350:1.0) -- ++ (1,0)    ;
\draw [green, very thick,  fill=yellow!10, yshift=.83cm]  (0,-1)-- ++(1,0) arc (190:540:1.0)  -- ++(-1,0)  ;
\begin{scope}[transform canvas={scale=.1},overlay,shift={(-1,-1.8)}]

Answer the following questions: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item What is the total number of microstates in this system 
\item What is the most likely arrangement of the molecules  
\item What is the least likely arrangement of the molecules 
\item What is the probability of finding the system in the most likely arrangement of the molecules 
 \end{inparaenum}

\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Overall we have three different scenarios. We can find all the molecules in the left container, all the molecules in the right container, or one molecule in the left and the other in the right. As the molecules are different, we only have one microstate in which both are in a single container. Differently, we have two different microstates in which the particles are distributed. Overall we have 4 microstates, the probability of finding the particles on both sides would be $2/4\times 100$=50\%.
