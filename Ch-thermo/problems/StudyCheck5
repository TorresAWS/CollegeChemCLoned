A 1L sample of methane at 6atm is heated from 100K to 300K. Assuming ideal gas behavior:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  Calculate the entropy change is the gas is heated at constant volume.
\item  Calculate the entropy change is the gas is heated at constant pressure.
 \end{inparaenum}

Answer:   
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item   20.04J/K
\item   20.04J/K
 \end{inparaenum}
