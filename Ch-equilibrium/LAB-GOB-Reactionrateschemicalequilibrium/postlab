\item{} For the reaction below write down the expression of K$_c$ 
\begin{center}\ce{ H2CO3_{(aq)} <=> HCO3^{-}_{(Aq)} + H^+_{(Aq)}}\end{center}
\item{}  The chemical equilibrium that controls the PH of blood is
\begin{center}\ce{CO2_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)} <=> HCO3^{-}_{(Aq)} + H^+_{(Aq)}}\end{center}
Respiratory  alkalosis is caused by a lack of carbon dioxide in the blood that results from poor lung function or depressed breathing. When a patient has respiratory alkalosis, breathing from a paper bag can help. Based on the equilibrium, explain why this simple technique works.
