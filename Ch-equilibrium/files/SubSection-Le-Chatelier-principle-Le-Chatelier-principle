When a reaction is in equilibrium the forward and reverse reactions proceed at the same speed. Also in an equilibrium state, the concentrations of reactants and products have very specific values. Imagine that you create stress conditions by adding reactants or products or even changing the temperature. This stress will have an impact on the equilibrium and the reaction eventually will reach a new state of equilibrium by somehow counteracting this stress.
 Le Ch\^{a}telier principle says that when stress is placed in a reaction (adding or removing reactant or products, increasing or decreasing temperature) the equilibrium will be shifted in the direction that relieves that stress. 
Table \ref{tab:Table-Le-chatelier} displays different aspects regarding Le Ch\^{a}telier's principle in terms of parameter change and consequence.
