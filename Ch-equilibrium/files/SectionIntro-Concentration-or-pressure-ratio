In a chemical reaction, if we prepare a mixture of reactants they will generate products. At equilibrium reactants and products exist at a very specific ratio given by the equilibrium constant. 
What if we would prepare a mixture containing both reactants and products? Given that both reactants and products are related by an equilibrium, how would the concentrations change?
In other words, would the reaction proceed towards the right producing products or the left producing reactants? This section introduces the use of a concentration (or pressure) ratio that helps predicts the direction in which a mixture of reactants and products will proceed towards the equilibrium.
