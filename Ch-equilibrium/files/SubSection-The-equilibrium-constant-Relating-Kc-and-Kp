The values of $K_{c}$ and $K_{p}$ are related by the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{  K_p=K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation3}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $K_p$   is the equilibrium constant in terms of pressure
 \item $K_c$   is the equilibrium constant in terms of concentration
 \item $R$  is the constant of the gases in pressure units (0.082 atmL/molK)
  \item $T$  is the absolute temperature (in Kelvins)
    \item $\Delta n$  is the change of stoichiometry of the reaction
\end{where}
Let us analyze the role of $\Delta n$ for the reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{C3H8 + 5O2 <=> 4H2O + 3CO2}\end{center}  
$\Delta n$ represents the number of molecules of products with respect to the number of molecules of reactants: 7-6=1. For this reaction, we have that $K_p=K_c (RT)$. However, the power of the relationship will depend on the stoichiometry of the reaction. At the same time, the relationship between both constants depends on the temperature.
