Once products form, they can follow a backward reaction to regenerate the reactants, and at the same time, reactants regenerate and produce products. Overall, chemical reactions proceed until reaching equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions determine how profitable a reaction can be as they describe how much of the products stay as products. This chapter covers the idea and basic principles of chemical equilibrium. We will describe the role of an equilibrium constant, which gives insight into the mixtures of reactants and products in equilibrium. Also, we will discuss the different types of equilibrium constants in terms of molarity and pressure and the role of a reaction quotient that gives insight into the direction in which a chemical reaction proceeds towards the equilibrium. Finally, we will coverÂ  Le Ch\^{a}telier principle that describes the direction in which a chemical reaction proceeds to recover the equilibrium state, after equilibrium is altered.
