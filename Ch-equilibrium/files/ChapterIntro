Once the products are formed they can follow a backward reaction to regenerate the reactants and at the same time, reactants regenerate produce products. Overall chemical reactions proceed until an equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium conditions determine how profitable a reaction can be as it describes how much of the products stay as products. This chapter covers the idea and basic principles of chemical equilibrium. We will describe the role of an equilibrium constant which gives insight into the mixtures of reactants and products in equilibrium. Also, we will discuss the different types of equilibrium constants in terms of molarity and pressure and the role of a reaction quotient giving insight into the direction in which a chemical reaction proceeds towards the equilibrium. Finally, we will cover  Le Ch\^{a}telier principle that describes once an equilibrium is altered, in which direction does a chemical reaction proceed to recover the equilibrium state.
