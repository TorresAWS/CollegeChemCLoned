The equilibrium constant associated with a reaction $K_c$ indicates whether reactants or products are abundant at equilibrium. Each reaction has one $K_c$ value that depends only on temperature and the subscript $_c$ represents concentration. On one hand, if $K_c$ is larger than one there will be a larger concentration of products than reactants in the equilibrium mixture. On the other hand, if  $K_c$ is smaller than one there will be a larger concentration of reactants than products in the equilibrium mixture. If  $K_c$ is close to one then both reactants and products will have the same concentration in the equilibrium mixture.

In terms of units, equilibrium constants are unitless numbers--a number without units. In other words, they have no unit and they are simply expressed as a number.
