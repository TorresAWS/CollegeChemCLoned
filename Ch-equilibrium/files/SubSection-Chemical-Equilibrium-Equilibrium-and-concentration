It is just a matter of time before a reaction reaches equilibrium. Initially, the forward process normally proceeds at high speed as products start to form. This is because initially there is an abundance of reactants. Once the products start to accumulate the forward process will start happening. This is because at that point there is an increasing amount of product molecules that can go back to reactants. Eventually, the forward and reverse rates become equal as the reaction reaches equilibrium. When the equilibrium has been reached, reactants and products have very specific concentrations. At the same time, a reaction in equilibrium contains a mixture of reactants and products.
