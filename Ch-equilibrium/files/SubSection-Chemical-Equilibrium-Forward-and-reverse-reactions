In chemical reactions, reactants form products. We call this the \emph{forward reaction}:
\begin{center}reactants $\ce{->}$ products \end{center}
However, once the products form they can also generate reactants through the \emph{reverse reaction}: 
\begin{center}reactants $\ce{<-}$ products\end{center}
