Concentration ratios helps predict whether a reaction will proceed towards the left or towards the right when we start with a mixture of reactants and products away from equilibrium.

If $Q_c$ is larger than $K_c$ the reaction will proceed towards the left producing reactants. On the other hand, if $Q_c$ is smaller than $K_c$ the reaction will proceed towards the right producing products. If $Q_c$ equals to $K_c$ then the reaction is in equilibrium.
