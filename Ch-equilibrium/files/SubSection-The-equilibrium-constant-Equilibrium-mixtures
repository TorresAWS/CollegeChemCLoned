Imagine you start a chemical reaction. Initially, products will form and reactants will disappear. At equilibrium, you will have a mixture of reactants and products with the forward and reverse processes happening at the same rate. The question is: an equilibrium mixture would contain more reactants or perhaps more products? The equilibrium constant helps predict just that.
