Consider the following reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{2SO2(g) + O2(g) <=> 2SO3(g)}\end{center}
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item Write down the expression of $K$.
\item Calculate the numerical value of $K$ for the reaction if the concentrations at equilibrium at 1000K are 2M for \ce{SO3}, 0.3M for \ce{O2} and 1M for \ce{SO2}.
\item indicate whether an equilibrium mixture will contain mostly products, mostly reactants or maybe both.
 \end{inparaenum}
