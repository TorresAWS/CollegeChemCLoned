For next endothermic reaction indicate whether the reaction will shift right (\ce{->}) or left (\ce{<-}) after the following changes:
 \begin{equation*} \ce{N2(g) + O2(g) +  \text{Heat} <=> 2NO(g) } \end{equation*}
 (a) adding reactants (b) adding products (c) decreasing the temperature. 
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) Adding reactants always displaces the equilirbium so that reactants are consumed, hence the reaction will proceed \ce{->}. (b) After adding products the reaction will tend to reduce the amount of products, and hence it will go \ce{<-}. (c) The reaction is endothermic that means that it consumes heat. If we decrease the temperature it will tend to increase the temperature and hence heat needs to be formed. This will only happen if the reaction proceeds (\ce{<-}).
