The value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction \begin{center}\ce{C3H8 + 5O2 <=> 4H2O + 3CO2}\end{center}  is $500$ at a given temperature. An analysis of an equilibrium mixture gave a concentration of water, carbon dioxide and \ce{C3H8} of 1M. Calculate the equilibrium concentration of oxygen at that temperature.\\
