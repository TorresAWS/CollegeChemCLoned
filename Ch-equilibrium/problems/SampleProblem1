Write down the forward and reverse reactions for:
\begin{center}\ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) <=> CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)}\end{center}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) The forward reaction is \ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)} and the reverse \ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) <- CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)}
