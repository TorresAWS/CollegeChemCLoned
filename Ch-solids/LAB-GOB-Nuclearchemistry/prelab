\item Classify the following decays as $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ or positron emission:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item \centerline{\ce{^235_92U -> ^231_90Th + ^4_2He} }
\item \centerline{\ce{^235_92U -> ^235_92Np + ^0_{0}\gamma} }
\item \centerline{\ce{^14_6C -> ^14_7N + ^0_{-1}e} }
\item \centerline{\ce{^222_88Ra -> ^4_2He + ^226_{88}Ra} }

\item Iodine-131 is used to treat certain types of thyroid cancer and some rarer types of cancer. Given that its half-life is 8days, calculate the amount of iodine of a 4g sample that remains after 10 days.

\item Strontium-89  is used to treat some types of secondary bone cancer. Given that its half-life is 50days, calculate the time needed to reduce a 4g sample into 2g.

\item Iron-59 is used in studies of iron metabolism in the spleen. A Iron-59 sample has an activity of 20cpm and 10cpm 46 days after the first measurement. Calculate the half life of the isotope.
