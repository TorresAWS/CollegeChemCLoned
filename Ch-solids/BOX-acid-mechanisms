 Five different factors contribute to the acidity of a chemical. 
\begin{solutionbox} \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}First Factor:\end{bf}   the larger the electronegativity of the atom directly connected to hydrogen the stronger acidity. 
\item \begin{bf}Second Factor:\end{bf}   the heavier the atom connected to hydrogen the stronger acidity. 
\item \begin{bf}Third Factor:\end{bf}   the larger the electronegativity of an atom secondarily connected to hydrogen the stronger acidity. 
\item \begin{bf}Fourth Factor:\end{bf}    the larger the number of electronegative atoms indirectly connected to hydrogen the stronger acidity. 
\item \begin{bf}Fifth Factor:\end{bf}   a possible stabilization of the corresponding anion generated by the dissociation of acid increases acidity strength.
\end{enumerate}
