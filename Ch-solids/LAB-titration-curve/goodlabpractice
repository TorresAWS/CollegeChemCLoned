      \item Burets are read from top to bottom.
	\item The volume added is calculated by difference. It is not necessary to start from 0 mL.
       \item Use a funnel to fill the buret but remove it always before the first reading. Drops from the funnel will affect the measurements.
	\item Do \textbf{never} refill the buret with the Erlenmeyer/beaker of the analyte below it. A spill would ruin the titration.
