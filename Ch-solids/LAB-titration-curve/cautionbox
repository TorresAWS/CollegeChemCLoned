      \begin{itemize} [label={\danger}]
		\item The pH will change very slowly at the beginning and at the end of the titration. However, around the equivalence point the pH will change extremely fast with small additions of the titrant. 
		\item The points around the equivalence point are very important, therefore special care should be taken not to miss them.
		\item Add the titrant in 1 mL portions. After every addition, estimate how much the pH changed from the previous pH measurement. If the pH has changed by less than 0.3 pH-units, add 1 mL of titrant in the next step. If the pH has changed 0.3 pH-units or more, begin adding the titrant in 0.2 mL portions.
		\item When adding 0.2 mL portions, if the pH change starts to slow down and increases by less that 0.3 pH-units between measurements \textbf{for at least 3 measurements in a row}, then you can start adding 1 mL portions again.
		\item The volume added does not have to be exactly 1.00 mL or 0.20 mL, but the buret reading must be precise.
