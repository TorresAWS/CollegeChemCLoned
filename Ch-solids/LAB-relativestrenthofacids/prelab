\item pH.\vspace{1cm}

\item You add a few drops of tymol blue to a clear solution and its color quickly changes to red. What is the PH range of the solution?\vspace{1cm} 
\item You add a few drops of tymol blue to a clear solution and its color quickly changes to orange. What is the PH range of the solution? \vspace{1cm}
\item Name the three methods to determine pH to be used in this laboratory.\vspace{2cm}
\item Order the three methods from the most accurate to the least accurate, according to your expectations.\vspace{2cm}
\item We test a sample with three different indicators by dividing the sample into three small samples. Each small sample is tested using an indicator from the following list: \begin{inparaenum}[i)]
\item Indicator A is colorless for pH values lower than 10 and turns pink for a pH greater than 10. 
\item Indicator B is blue up to pH 3, then it turns colorless. 
\item Indicator C is colorless for a pH lower than 6 when it turns red. The red color changes to yellow between pH 9 and pH 10, and stays yellow for higher pH values.
 \end{inparaenum}
Estimate the pH range for the solution if the samples tested with indicators A and B become colorless and the one tested with indicator C turns reddish.\vspace{2cm}
