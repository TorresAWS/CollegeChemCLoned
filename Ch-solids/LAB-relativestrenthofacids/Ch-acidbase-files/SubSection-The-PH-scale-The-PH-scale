The proton concentrations in aqueous solutions tend to be rather small. For example, the proton concentration in normal vinegar is $2\cdot 10^{-3}$M. As it is hard to work with these small concentrations, scientists developed the PH scale that transforms $\big[ \ce{H^+}\big]$ into a larger number. The formula for the PH is:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{PH=-log \big[ \ce{H^+} \big]  }\label{\chapterlabel:equation3}
\end{equation}
The PH scale normally ranges from 0 to 14. PH values lower than 7 correspond to acidic solutions, whereas PH values larger than 7 correspond to basic solutions. Solutions with PH of 7 are neutral. 
For example, the PH for vinegar is $-log \big( 2\cdot 10^{-3}\big)$ that is 2.69. However, it exists PH values out of the scale for very concentrated solutions. Examples of PH values and common chemicals are given in the figure below.
An equivalent scale is also defined for the concentration of hydroxyls. The POH values is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{POH=-log \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]  }\label{\chapterlabel:equation4}
\end{equation}
The POH scale also ranges from 0 to 14. POH values lower than 7 correspond to this time to basic solutions, whereas POH values larger than 7 correspond to acidic solutions. Solutions with POH of 7 are neutral. The values of PH and POH are hence related by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{PH + POH = 14  }\label{\chapterlabel:equation5}
\end{equation}
For example, if the PH of a solution is 4 therefore the POH will be 10. Both indicators suggest that the solution would be acidic.
