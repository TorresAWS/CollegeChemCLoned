This second section will cover the acid and base dissolution in water. Water plays a key role in the acid-base character of a chemical as these chemicals ultimately react with water. When acids and bases solve in water, they dissociate producing a byproduct called the conjugate base and conjugate acid. We will describe how to set up the dissociation equilibrium and how to identify conjugate acid-base pairs.
