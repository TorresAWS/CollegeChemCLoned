We can also employ the endpoint formula to locate the volume of titrant needed to reach each of the end points during the titration. For example, when titrating a 10mL sample of 0.1M phosphoric acid with 0.1M-\ce{NaOH}, we would need 10mL to reach the first end point, 20mL to reach the second end point, and a total of 30mL to reach the third and last end point, completely neutralizing the acid.
