Remember that strong acids (bases) produce weak conjugate bases (acids). Similarly, weak acids (bases) produce strong conjugate bases (acids). For example, \ce{HF} is a weak acid, and therefore its conjugate \ce{F^-} acid would be fairly strong. Similarly, \ce{NaOH} is a strong base and its conjugate acid (\ce{Na^+}) is therefore fairly weak. Now, let us think about the acid-base properties of \ce{NaF}, a salt. Remember that salt is just a common name to refer to ionic compounds resulting from the combination of metallic and nonmetallic elements. Without doing any type of calculation we can predict that as \ce{Na^+} is a weak acid and \ce{F^-} a strong base. Therefore, a \ce{NaF} solution would be basic. Similarly, we can predict that \ce{NH4Cl} would from an acidic solution, as ammonium (\ce{NH4^+}) is the conjugate acid of ammonia (a weak base) and \ce{Cl^-} is the conjugate base of a strong acid (\ce{HCl}).
