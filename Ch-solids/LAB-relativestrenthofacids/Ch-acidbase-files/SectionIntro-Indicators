There are several techniques to locate the endpoint during a titration. On one hand, we can use a PH meter and measure PH during the titration. The endpoint locates between the initial and final plateau. We can also use an automatic titrator, a machine that automatically mixes the acid and the base while displaying the PH. Another technique uses an indicator that changes color when the PH changes from acidic to basic or the opposite.
