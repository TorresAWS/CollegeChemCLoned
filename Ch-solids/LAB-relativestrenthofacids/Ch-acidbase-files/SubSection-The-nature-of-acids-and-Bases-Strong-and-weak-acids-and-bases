Strong acids are strong electrolytes that completely dissociate to produce protons. Similarly, strong bases completely dissociate in solution generating hydroxyls. On the contrary, weak acids and bases are just weak electrolytes that dissociate partially in solution generating only a small amount of protons and hydroxyls. The dissociation of strong acids and bases is represented by means of a single arrow, whereas the dissociation of weak acids and bases is represented by means of a double harpoon. For example, hydrochloric acid is a strong electrolyte and its dissociation is represented by 
\begin{center}\ce{HCl_{(g)}  -> Cl^-_{(aq)} + H^+_{(aq)}}\hfill (strong acid)\end{center}
whereas hydrofluoric acid is a weak electrolyte and its dissociation is represented by 
\begin{center}\ce{HF_{(g)}  <=>  F^-_{(aq)} + H^+_{(aq)}}\hfill (weak acid)\end{center}
