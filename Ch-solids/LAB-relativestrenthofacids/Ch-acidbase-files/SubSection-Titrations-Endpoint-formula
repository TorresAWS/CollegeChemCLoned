At the equivalency point the moles of acid and the moles of base are the same. A simple formula is extensively used to calculate the unknown acid concentration in a titration:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{n_{H}\cdot c_a\cdot V_a=n_{OH}\cdot c_b\cdot V_b }
\label{\chapterlabel:equation13}
 \end{equation} 
 where:
\begin{where}
 \item $n_{H}\cdot c_a\cdot V_a$  and $n_{OH}\cdot c_b\cdot V_b$ is moles of protons and hydroxyls, respectively
 \item $c_a$ and $V_a$ is acid concentration and volume respectively
 \item $c_b$ and $V_b$ is base concentration and volume respectively
  \item $n_{H}$ and $n_{OH}$ is the number of protons of the acid and hydroxyls of the base
\end{where}
 Regarding the units in this formula, the units in $V_a$ and $V_b$ can either be $L$ or $mL$. They just need to be the same units. This formula can be used for example when we titrate a given acid amount with a known base and we arrive to the volume of based needed to the end point with the aim of calculating the molarity of the acid. This formula can also be used when we titrate a known acid with a known base and we need to calculate the volume of titrant needed to reach the endpoint.




Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation13} can also be used to identify if we already passed the endpoint in a titration. For example, we titrate 2mL of 3M \ce{H2SO4} (titrant) with 2mL of 1M \ce{NaOH} (titrate). The question would be: are be before, after or at the endpoint? We have that in order to neutralize completely the titrant (\ce{H2SO4}), and using Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation13} we would need:
\[2\cdot 3M\cdot 2mL=1\cdot 1M\cdot V_b\]
that is we would need 12 mL of base. Therefore, as we only used 2mL we would be before the end point and we would have not reached the endpoint.\\
