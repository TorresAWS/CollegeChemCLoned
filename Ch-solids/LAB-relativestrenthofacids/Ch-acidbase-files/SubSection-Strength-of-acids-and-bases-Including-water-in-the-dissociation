Let us consider an acid such as \ce{HCl}. We know acids produce protons (\ce{H^+} or \ce{H3O^+}) so we can express the acid dissociation as:
\begin{center}\ce{HCl(l) ->[H2O] H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)}\end{center}
We indicate water on top of the arrow in order to represent that the dissociation process happens in water. There is an alternative way to represent this process by including explicitly water:
\begin{center}\ce{HCl_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)}	-> H3O^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)}}\end{center}
This way we explicitly represent the role of water as a proton receiver. Ultimately, both ways are correct and for some chemicals (e.g. \ce{NH3}) it is more convenient to use the role of water whereas for others it makes no difference.
In the following, we present more examples. For the case of \ce{HNO3}, nitric acid, we have:
\begin{center}\ce{HNO3(l) ->[H2O] H^+(aq) +NO3^-(aq)}\end{center}
that means once dissolved in water, nitric acid gives a proton and forms a nitrate \ce{NO3^-} cation. Some other acids, such as \ce{H2SO4} are diprotic, as they have two protons and hence they can loose both while reaction with water:
\begin{center}\ce{H2SO4(l) ->[H2O] 2H^+(aq) +SO4^{2-}(aq)}\end{center}
Bases produce hydroxyls (\ce{OH^-}) and an example of a base dissociation would be:
\begin{center}\ce{NaOH(l) ->[H2O] Na^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)}\end{center}
