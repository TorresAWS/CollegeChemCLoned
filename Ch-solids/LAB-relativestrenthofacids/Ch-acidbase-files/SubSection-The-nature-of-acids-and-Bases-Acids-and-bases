Acids have very different properties than bases. Acids are acidic, have a sour taste, and can sting to the touch. Bases are basic, have a bitter--chalky--taste, and they feel soapy--slippery--to the touch.
On one hand, acids are extensively used in the food and perfume industry. For example, vinegar--a liquid solution of acetic acid--is used in pickles and food preparations. On the other hand, lemon and orange juice, containing citric acid, is used in the preparation of effervescent salts and as food preservatives. Acids are also used in the production of batteries. For example, car batteries contain corrosive sulphuric acid. 
On the other hand, bases are extensively used in manufacturing. As a first example, sodium hydroxide is used in the manufacture of soap, medicines, and even paper. As a second example, calcium hydroxide--also known as slaked lime--is used to neutralize the acid in water supplies or as an antidote for food poisoning. This hydroxide is also used in the construction industry, mixed with sand and water to make mortar. As a third example, potassium hydroxide (\ce{KOH}), is used in alkali batteries. 
Finally, ammonia is an extensively used cleaning product, also used to remove ink spots from clothes or grease from window-panes.
