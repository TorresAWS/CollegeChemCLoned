This section describes the PH scale that simply transforms a concentration value--often times a very small number--into a simple round value. In short, the PH value tells you how much protons are there in a solution so that the larger PH the fewer protons are there in solution. It also informs about the hydroxyl concentration, as protons and hydroxyls are connected by means of the dissociation equilibrium of water.
