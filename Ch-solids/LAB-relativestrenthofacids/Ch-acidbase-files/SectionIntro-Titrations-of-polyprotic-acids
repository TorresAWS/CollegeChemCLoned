Monoprotic acids contain a single proton. Examples are hydrochloric acid (\ce{HCl}) and nitric acid (\ce{HNO3}). Polyprotic acids contain more than one proton. Examples are sulfuric acid (\ce{H2SO4}), a diprotic acid, and phosphoric acid, (\ce{H3PO4}). When titrating an acid, the number of protons determines the number of endpoints observed. Monoprotic acids go through a single end point, whereas diprotic acids go through two different end points.
