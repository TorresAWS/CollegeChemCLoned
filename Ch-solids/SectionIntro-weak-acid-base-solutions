The PH of solutions of weak electrolytes differs from that of stronger electrolytes. Weak electrolytes have effective concentrations that differ from their nominal ones. Not all the amount of substance you use to prepare the solution becomes ions, and those electrolytes have a percent dissociation different than 100\%. Hence, the calculations involved in the PH calculation of weak acids and bases involved more complicated calculations. This section addresses the calculation of PH for solutions of weak acids and bases, as well as the PH of salt solutions.
