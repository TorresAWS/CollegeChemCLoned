\begin{enumerate}

\item Commercial bleach claims a 5.25\% NaClO by weight. Assuming a density of 1.0 g/mL for NaClO obtain the molarity of the solution. Consider your results in the laboratory, is the claim true?\vspace{5cm}


\item Considering the bleach-water ratio of eight bleach drops per water gallon, what is the concentration, in molarity, of NaClO in the dilution?
