The concentration of a solution refers to the amount of solute with respect to the amount of solution. The larger concentration the larger the number of solute particles with respect to the particles of solvent. Concentration is one of the most important properties of a solution as it affect the physical properties of a solution such as the freezing and boiling point. There are many different concentration units, such as molarity, mass percent concentration, or volume percent concentration. All these different units overall express the ration between the particles--mass or volume--of solute and solvent.
