There are three different reactions in solution: acid-base reactions, precipitation reaction and redox reactions. The key to identify acid-base reactions is in the reactants, as an acid-base reaction results from the reaction between and acid and a base. Precipitation reactions are reactions that produce a precipitate. Hence, the key to identify a precipitation reaction is in the products. Precipitation reactions always contains a solid as a product. Redox reactions contain two elements with different redox number in the reactants and products. The key to identify redox reactions is to be able to spot elements with different oxidation state, for example: \ce{Cu} and \ce{Cu^{2+}} or \ce{H^+} and \ce{H2}. In the following we will describe more about the three different types of reactions in solution. The goal of this section is for you to be able to identify each type.
