Precipitation reactions result in an insoluble chemical. An example would be:\\
\ce{K2CrO4_{(aq)} + Ba(NO3)2_{(aq)} -> BaCrO4_{(s)} v + 2KNO3_{(aq)}    \textcolor{red}{ (precipitation reaction) }      }\\
The chemical \ce{BaCrO4_{(s)}} is a solid that precipitates in the solution.
The solubility of a given solute such as \ce{BaCrO4_{(s)}} is the amount of solute (in grams) that can be dissolve in a given mass of solvent (in particular 100 g of solvent). A solute with a low solubility will be hard to dissolve. Think about cacao and water. The solubility of cacao is low and hence by simply adding cacao powder to water you will not be able to make a solution. However, solubility depends on the solute and solvent combination, but also on the temperature and by warming up a solvent you can increase solubility and fit more solute in the same amount of solvent. This section covers different aspects of solubility.
