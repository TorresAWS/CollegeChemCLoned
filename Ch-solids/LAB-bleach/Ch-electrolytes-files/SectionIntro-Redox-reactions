Redox reaction are different than acid-base or precipitation reaction. They contain the same chemical element in two different states resulting from the loss or win of electrons. For example:
\begin{center}\ce{2Al_{(s)} + 3Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} -> 2Al^{3+}_{(aq)} + 3Cu_{(s)} }    \textcolor{red}{ (redox reaction) }      \end{center}
We have that neither \ce{Al_{(s)}} or \ce{Cu^{2+}_{(aq)}} are an acid or a base. Also there is no product precipitate. Hence, this reaction is not an acid-base reaction or a precipitation reaction. This is a redox reaction, as we have \ce{Al} in two different states: as metallic \ce{Al_{(s)}} and as ionic  \ce{Al^{3+}_{(aq)}}, which result from the loss of an electron. In redox reaction there is always elements in the chemicals that lose electrons and chemicals winning electrons.
