Different metals have different density. The value for density will depend on the cell parameter but also on the compacity of the unit cell, the more compact the unit cell the more atoms per cell and hence the more density. The formula that relates density with cell parameter and atoms per cell is:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  d=\frac{N\cdot AW}{c^3\cdot 6.023\times 10^{-7}}  } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Metallic density formula}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $d$   is the density in $g\cdot ml^{-1}$
 \item $N$   is the number of atoms per unit cell 
  \item $6.023\times 10^{-7}$ is related to the conversion between atoms and grams
 \item $AW$  is the atomic weight of the metal
  \item $c$  is the cell parameter in pm
\end{where}
