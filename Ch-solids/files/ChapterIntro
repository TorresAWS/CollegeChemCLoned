\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{here} are three different states of the matter: solid, liquid and gas. This chapter fully deals with the properties of solids and liquids. Liquids have indeed very peculiar properties and this chapter will cover--among others--the vapor pressure. Liquids are not isolated; they are normally in contact with the atmosphere. The liquid molecules which are closer to the air can scape forming a vapor; this vapor exerts certain pressure. This vapor is what you feel, for example, when the weather is very humid. Finally, this chapter covers the idea of intermolecular forces. The molecules of an ideal gas are independent of each other. This means they do not see each other at all--they do not interact with each other. Differently, the molecules of liquids and solids interact with each other through strong forces that act between molecules--these are called intermolecular forces. The properties of these forces will help you understand why some liquids boil at higher temperatures than others or why some solids have higher melting points.
