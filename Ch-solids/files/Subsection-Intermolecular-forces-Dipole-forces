Atoms have different electronegativity that is, a different tendency to attract the electron density in a bond. 
In the periodic table, electronegativity increases going from left to right and top to bottom. Elements in the top right of the table (Cl, F) tend to be very electronegative and hence they tend to strongly attract the electrons on a chemical bonds. Differently, elements on the bottom left part of the table are electropositive and they tend to give away the electrons in the bond. Dipole moments result from differences in electronegativity. When a electronegative atoms is connected to a electropositive atom in a bond, the electronegativity difference creates permanent dipole moments and molecules with permanent dipole moment are called polar molecules. The dipole moment of a bond is a vector that points from the most electropositive atom to the most electronegative atom. For example for the O-H and N-H bonds,
\begin{center}\chemfig{
        \chemabove[3pt]{N}{\pol{-} }(-[::270,0.5,,,draw=none]@{a})-
        \chemabove[3pt]{H}{\pol{+}}(-[::270,0.5,,,draw=none]@{b})
        }
\chemmove{
          \draw[|->, very thick] (b)--(a);
         } 
\qquad
\chemfig{
         \chemabove[3pt]{H}{ \pol{+}}(-[::270,0.5,,,draw=none]@{c})-
         \chemabove[3pt]{O}{ \pol{-}}(-[::270,0.5,,,draw=none]@{d})
        }
\chemmove{
          \draw[|->, very thick] (c)--(d);
          }
\end{center}
As such, the molecule \ce{HCl} would be polar as results from the combination of a electropositive atom (H) and an electronegative atom (Cl). Similarly, \ce{HF} would be a polar molecule too. Dipole-dipole forces exist only in polar compounds, being the result of permanent dipole moments.  This types of interactions are stronger that dispersion forces but weaker than normal interatomic covalent bonds. Molecules with dipole moment can attract each other by means of dipole forces, orienting themselves so that their positive side aligns with the negative side maximizing the electrostatic attraction. At the same type, dipole forces depend on the distance and at large distance are less effective.
The dipole moment of a molecule is measured in Debye (D). For example, the dipole moment of \ce{HCl} is 1.05D, whereas the dipole moment of \ce{HF} is 1.82D. The stronger the dipole moment the stronger the dipole-dipole interactions. For example, when comparing \ce{C3H8} and \ce{CH3OCH3}, the former has a almost null dipole moment, whereas the later has a dipole moment of 1.3D. The boiling point of  \ce{C3H8} is -42$^\circ$C whereas the boiling point of \ce{CH3OCH3} is -25$^\circ$C. The table below list some dipole moments and boiling points showing the trend that the larger the dipole moment the higher (more positive) the boiling point.
