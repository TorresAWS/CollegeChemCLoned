A phase diagram is just a diagram with temperature in the X axis and pressure in the Y axis. It tells you whether you have gas, liquid or gas at a large range of pressure and temperature conditions. For example, the figure on the side of the page presents the phase diagram of water and the line indicates the phase present at (Temperature, Pressure) conditions of (25 C$^{\circ}$,1 atm). Obviously, this phase is liquid water. \emph{Normal conditions} refer to pressure conditions of 1 atm. Hence, we say that the normal boiling point of water--this means at 1 atm--is 100 C$^{\circ}$. In the following we will analyze a set of experiments represented as vertical and horizontal lines in the diagram. Horizontal lines are cooling/heating experiments in which pressure is kept fixed and temperature changes. Vertical lines represent compression/decompression experiments in which pressure changes at constant temperature.
