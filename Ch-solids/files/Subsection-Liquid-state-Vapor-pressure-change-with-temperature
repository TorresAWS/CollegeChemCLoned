This vapor pressure strongly depends on temperature. That is the reason why summer days can also be humid days if you live near the seaside. In particular, this change depends on the value of the heat of vaporization. The reason for this, is because at higher temperature more molecules have enough kinetic energy to scape from the liquid into the gas phase. For chemicals with low heat of vaporization we can expect a more sharp change of the vapor pressure with temperature.
The following formula gives the relation between vapor pressure and temperature. Mind that for every temperature we will have a vapor pressure value. In the formula you will to pairs of temperatures and hence two pairs of vapor pressures:

\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  Ln\Bigg(\frac{P^{vap}_{T_1} }{P^{vap}_{T_2}}\Bigg)=\frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}\Bigg(\frac{1}{T_2}-\frac{1}{T_1}\Bigg)  } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Clausius-Clapeyron relation}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P^{vap}_{T_1}$  is the vapor pressure at temperature $T_1$ in Kelvin
 \item $P^{vap}_{T_2}$  is the vapor pressure at temperature $T_2$ in Kelvin
  \item $\Delta H_{vap}$ is the enthalpy of vaporization in $J\cdot mol^{-1}$
  \item $R$=8.314J$\cdot K^{-1} mol^{-1}$ is the constant of the gases in energy units
\end{where}
