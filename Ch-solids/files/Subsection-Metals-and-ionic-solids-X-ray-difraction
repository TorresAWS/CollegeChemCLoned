X-ray diffraction is an experimental technique used to study the structure of solids and specifically to obtain cell parameters--the length of the unit cell that defines the structure of a crystal. X-rays, high-frequency radiation, scatter when they encounter a regular array of atoms in which the spacing is compatible with the x-ray wavelength. Diffraction results in two different types of wave interference: constrictive and destructive. Constructive interference results in bright spots and destructive interference results in dark spots. Waves impacting atoms at a different lattice positions travel different distances. If the difference in distance equals to an integral number of wavelength there both rays will interfere constructively.
Bragg's equation relate the cell parameter ($d$) of a solid with the angle ($\theta$) of the diffracted x-rays and its wavelength ($\lambda$). The number $n$ is called the diffraction order and represents an integer values ($n$=0, 1, 2, $\dots$).
\begin{equation}
n\lambda = 2d sin\theta
