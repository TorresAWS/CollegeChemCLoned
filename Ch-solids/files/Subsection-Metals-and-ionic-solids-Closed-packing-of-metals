Metallic solids result from the packing of metal atoms in space. Picture a single layer of spheres all packed together.  The most compact way to pack a layer of spheres is the situation in which one sphere is surrounded by six other spheres (layer A). This is called the closest packing. In this situation, every three spheres are connected by means of an indentation or dimple. Now let us think about how to pack a second layer on top of the first later. 
We can simply place the second layer just on top of the first layer (called layer A also). This would lead to a simple cubic packing arrangement (AA packing) which is not the most compact packing arrangement and the unit cell resulting from this packing is called \emph{simple cubic}. Differently, we could pack the second layer on the indentations of the first layer, which would lead to more complex packing schemes as we try to add a third layer. There would be two possible ways to add a third layer of atoms. You can locate the third layer on top of the first layer leading to an \ce{ABA} packing, with a resulting unit cell called \emph{hexagonal close cell, (hcp)}. Or you can locate the third layer on top of the indentations of the second layer leading to a \ce{ABC} layer packing leading to a unit cell called \emph{face centered cubic, (fcc)}.
