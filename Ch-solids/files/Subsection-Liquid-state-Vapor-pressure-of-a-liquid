The molecules of a liquid in contact with the atmosphere are more likely to scape into the gas phase forming what we call the vapor pressure of the liquid. 
When we put a liquid in a closed container, some of the liquid molecules would go into the gas. This process is called vaporization. Whereas molecules of the gas would also go back to the liquid phase. This process is called condensation. Therefore, vaporization and condensation compete until both processes occur at the same speed and the system reaches what we call as equilibrium. The vapor pressure at this state is called the equilibrium vapor pressure or simple the vapor pressure of the liquid.
This effect is responsible for the humidity the air and the smell of liquid chemicals. Chemicals with high vapor pressure vaporize readily and if they have a smell, one would be able to smell them.
Solids also have vapor pressure--solids also have a smell--as their molecules are also able to scape into a gas phase.
