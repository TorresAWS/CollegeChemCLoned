We will analyze now some cooling/heating experiments. In the first experiment, we start by having a solid that we  heat up to obtain first a mixture between liquid and solid and then a pure liquid. In this experiment we just transitioned between solid into a liquid. Experiment 2 is different. We also start by having a solid. The difference is that this time we reach a point called \emph{triple point} in this point the three phase coexist at a single pressure and temperature. Therefore, in this experiment, we go from a solid into a mixture of solid, liquid and gas. After that we transition directly into a gas. Experiment number three is called sublimation. In this experiment we start by having a solid that transitions into a gas by means of a mixture of solid and gas. We can also discuss some compression/decompression experiments. The first experiment is a compression experiment in which we start from a gas and we end up having a liquid by means of a mixture of both. The second experiment start beyond the \emph{critical point} and hence even if you compress the gas you will never reach a liquid state. The critical point is the point beyond which one cannot liquefy a gas or gasify a liquid.
