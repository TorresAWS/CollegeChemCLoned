A phase diagram is a representation of the different temperature and pressure conditions in which we can find the different states of matter of a substance. Normally, temperature is listed in the horizontal axis and pressure in the vertical axis. The different phase, liquid, solid and gas, are listed. At low temperature we tend to find solids and gases are common at high temperature. Similarly, at low pressures we tend to find gases and solids at high pressure. With pressure we refer to compressive pressure. 
The lines in a phase diagram represent equilibrium and the line separating solid and gas represents all the pressure and temperature conditions in which we can find a gas in equilibrium with a liquid. Similarly, the line separating liquid and solid represents all the pressure and temperature conditions in which we can find a liquid in equilibrium with a solid. With equilibrium, we mean that both phase are present and the process of phase transition proceeds at the same speed in both directions.There are two important points in a phase diagram: the critical point and the triple point. The triple point is the pressure and temperature conditions in which the three phases--solid, liquid and gas--coexist. Another important point is the critical point. Beyond this point one cannot liquefy (go from gas into a liquid) or condense (go from liquid into a gas) the substance. 
There is one more important feature one can extract from a phase diagram. Normally, but  not always, solids are more dense than liquids. We can compare the density of the solid and the liquid by analyzing the slope of the line connecting both phase. If the slope is lower than 90$^{\circ}$ then the solid will be more dense than the liquid. If it is larger than 90$^{\circ}$ then the solid is less dense than the liquid. If the slope is 90$^{\circ}$ then both liquid and solid have the same density.
