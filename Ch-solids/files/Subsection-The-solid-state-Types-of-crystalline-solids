Examples of crystalline solids are: sugar and table salt. These two solids have very different constitutions. Table salt is made of ions: \ce{Na+} and \ce{Cl-}. Sugar is made of molecules. We say \ce{NaCl} is an ionic solid, whereas sugar is a \emph{molecular solid}. Other examples of \emph{ionic solids}: \ce{MgO}, \ce{CaF2}. Other examples of \emph{molecular solids}: ice which is made of water molecules. A third type of crystalline solids are called \emph{atomic solids}, as they are made of atoms. Think of metallic iron or graphite. Both are atomic solids made of atoms, \ce{Fe} and \ce{C}. Overall, molecular solids are made or molecules--often times covalent molecules--whereas ionic solids are made of ions and result from ionic compounds. Finally, atomic solids are made of atoms. In the following we will study more about a specific type of atomic solids: metallic solids. Metallic solids are indeed atomic solids made of metallic elements, such as for example gold (\ce{Au_{(s)}}).
