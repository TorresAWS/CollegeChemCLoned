All molecules are made of atoms that contain electrons. The electron density of an atom is distributed homogeneously without uneven charge distributions. As a consequence, atoms in general have no permanent dipole moment without negatively or positively charged regions. Still, when two atoms get close together, the presence of each other affects their electron density creating temporary dipole moments. We call this effect polarizability. This temporary dipole is responsible for London dispersion forces, also called Van der Waals forces or simply dispersion forces.
Dispersion forces exist in all chemicals, as all chemicals can be polarized. The larger the atomic number, or the molar weight of the compound, the stronger these forces are. This is because in general the larger the atomic weight the more polarizable atoms are, and hence, they tend to generate stronger temporary dipoles, produced from charge polarization. 

The melting (or freezing) and boiling points of the noble gases are given in the Table below, where you can see how the larger the atomic mass of the gas the higher the melting--and boiling points. Mind that normally, the melting and freezing points of a substance are the same. Dispersion forces are common in chemicals made of hydrogen and carbon--we call these compounds hydrocarbons. The larger the size of the molecule the larger the effects of dispersion forces. For example:
