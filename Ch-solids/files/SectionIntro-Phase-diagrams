Water can be found at different states: liquid, solid and gas. We know at room temperature--and atmospheric pressure--water is a liquid. However, what if we warm up a sample of water? When does it become vapor? And more importantly, what if the working pressure is not one atmosphere? Would water boil the same near the sea or on top of a mountain? The answer to all these questions can be found in the phase diagram of water. This section will cover phase diagrams. You will learn how to read phase diagrams in order to predict the state of matter at any temperature and pressure conditions. You will also learn how to identify critical and triple points.
