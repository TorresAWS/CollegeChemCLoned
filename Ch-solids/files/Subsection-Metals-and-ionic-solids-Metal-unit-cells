Here we will cover three different metal unit cells, all cubic cells. First, the simple cubic unit cell, with an atom each of the vertexes of the cell. This is the less compact unit cell with one atom per unit cell. Second, the body-centered unit cell is a cubic unit cell with atoms in the vertex of the cell and a single atom in the center of the cell. This cell has two atoms per unit cell. Third, the face-centered unit cell, with atoms in the vertex of the cell and also on the faces of the cell, on the sides of the cube. This is the most compact unit cell, with four atoms per cell. In the following image you can manipulate a face-centered cubic cell.
