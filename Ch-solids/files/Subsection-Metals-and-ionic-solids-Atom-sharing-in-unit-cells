Before we cover the different metallic units cells let us talk about atom sharing. Think about a cubit unit cell, that is a cube with one sphere (atom) in every corner of the cube. The whole lattice is produced by repeating the unit cell on the three dimensions. Hence, every corner of the cube is shared among other corders. This means, every corner--containing an atom--shares that atom with all units cells connected to that corner. Therefore, those atoms in the corner are not whole part of a single unit cell and they are shares. Every corner of a cube is shared among eight other cubes. Imagine pilling numerous boxes in layers. Every corner of each box is shared by three other boxes in the same plane and by four boxes on the plane on top--that is a total of eight boxes. They way you need to think of the different atoms in a single unit cell, is that they are shared depending on their location. As we discussed, corners of a cubic unit cell are shared by a total of 8 others unit cells. Atoms that belong to a face of a unit cell are shared by two unit cells. Atoms that are inside a unit cell fully belong to a single unit cell and they are not shared. Atoms that belong to a edge of the cube--an edge is the line that connects two vertexes of a cube--are shared by four units cells.
