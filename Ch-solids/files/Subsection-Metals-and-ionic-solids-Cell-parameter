Cubic unit cells have the shape of a cube and hence all side of the cube have the same length. This length is called cell parameter $c$. Unit cells with large cell parameter have more spacing between atoms. The opposite is true for cells with smaller cell parameter. The cell parameter of a unit cell is related to the atomic radius. Let us analyze the case of a face-centered unit cell. In each side of the cell, in each face, we have four atoms in the vertexes and one in the center of the face. Of course these atoms do not belong only to this unit cell. However, if we symbolically cut the atoms in the face we can see the relation between the radius of the atom and the unit cell. The edges of the cell does not correspond to any cell parameter. However, the line that connect the bottom part with the opposite top part corresponds to a specific number of cell parameters, as the atoms are touching in this direction. In particular this distance is $4r$. Using Pythagoras theorem we have: $c^2+c^2=(4r)^2$. Therefore, $c=\sqrt{8}r$.
