The enthalpy of vaporization of a liquid ($\Delta H_{vap}$) is the energy needed to vaporize a liquid. This energy is often called heat of vaporization or molar heat of vaporization. Mind that $\Delta H_{vap}$ values are normally positive. This corresponds to the fact that we have to give energy to the liquid in order to create a vapor, and hence the process is endothermic. In general compounds with small heat of vaporization can vaporize easily. Think about the smell of a perfume you like. Now, think about the smell of water. Why a perfume smells and water does not. The enthalpy of vaporization of a perfume is small whereas  $\Delta H_{vap}$ for water is larger (41kJ/mol). This means it is easier for the perfume molecules to scape into the gas phase and hence produce a smell. Another example is acetone--nail polish remover. This chemical has a very distinctive smell. $\Delta H_{vap}$ for acetone is 31kJ/mol. If you compare this value with the value of water you can see acetone is more likely to have a smell.
