Hydrogen bonds are the strongest of all intermolecular forces and exist only in molecules containing very specific bonds; in particular, they only exist in molecules containing \ce{H-F}, \ce{H-N}, or \ce{H-O} bonds. An example of a molecule with hydrogen bonds is \ce{HF} or \ce{NH3}. Hydrogen bonds are a specific type of dipole-dipole interaction responsible, among others, for some of the high boiling points of water. Due to the existence of hydrogen bonds water is liquid at room temperature (\ce{H2O}, BP=100$^\circ$C), in comparison with similar molecules (\ce{H2S}, BP=-60$^\circ$C). The anomalous character of oxygen, fluorine, and nitrogen results from the fact that these are very electronegative elements with lone pairs of electrons--these are non-bonding pairs of electrons--that enable the creation of hydrogen bonds. In particular, oxygen has two lone pairs, nitrogen one and fluorine three. The combination of high electronegativity, the presence of lone pairs, and the presence of hydrogen atoms makes hydrogen bonds possible.
