Hydrogen bonds are the strongest of all intermolecular forces and exist only in molecules containing very specific bonds; in particular they only exist in molecules containing \ce{H-F}, \ce{H-N} or \ce{H-O} bonds. An example of molecule with hydrogen bonds are \ce{HF} or \ce{NH3}. Hydrogen bonds are a specific type dipole-dipole interactions responsible, among other, for some of the high boiling point of water. Due to the existence of hydrogen bonds water is liquid at room temperature (\ce{H2O}, BP=100$^\circ$C), in comparison with similar molecules (\ce{H2S}, BP=-60$^\circ$C). The anomalous character of oxygen, fluorine and nitrogen results from the fact that these are very electronegative elements with  lone pairs of electrons--these are non-bonding pairs of electrons--that enable the creation of hydrogen bonds. In particular, oxygen has two lone pairs, nitrogen one and fluorine three. The combination of high electronegativity, the presence of lone pairs and the presence of hydrogen atoms, makes hydrogen bond possible.
