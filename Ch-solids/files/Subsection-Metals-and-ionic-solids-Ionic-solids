Ionic solids have high melting point and they are typically hard. They also do not conduct the electricity in solid form. An example of an ionic solid is \ce{NaCl}. The structure of \ce{NaCl} and many other ionic solids results from the superposition of two different compact lattices--this is the reason these are called binary solids as they are made of two units--and each lattice is superimposed. Normally, the largest ion (\ce{Na^+}) forms a packed arrangement such as fcc or ccp, and the smallest ion (\ce{Cl^-}) resides on the holes of the lattice. Here we will care about constructing the formula of the unit cell, such as \ce{NaCl} by counting the atoms in the unit cell.
