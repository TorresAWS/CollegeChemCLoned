Viscosity ($\eta$) is the measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. High viscosity liquids flow slowly and this effect results from the intermolecular forces. Liquids with strong intermolecular forces tends to present high viscosities. Viscosity, as well as surface tension, depends on temperature and high temperature reduce the viscosity. Molecular complexity also affect viscosity and long molecules made of carbon and hydrogen have higher viscosities than small molecules due to the fact that because of their size they present more intermolecular interactions. The units of viscosity are milli Pascal-second, mPa$\cdot \text{s}$.
