Boiling a liquid requires energy. This energy is invested in separating the molecules from the liquid until they are spread apart. To separate the molecules of a liquid, we need to overcome intermolecular forces. Imagine boiling \ce{CH4}. We know the molecules of methane only interact among themselves through weak dispersion forces. Imagine now boiling water. Water is polar and water has \ce{O-H} bonds, hence water molecules interact through dispersion, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen bonds. The energy needed to separate the molecules of water will be larger than the energy required to separate the molecules of methane. The more intense the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point. Also, the more types of intermolecular forces present in a liquid the higher the boiling point. Finally, we can apply these ideas not only to liquids but also to solids.
