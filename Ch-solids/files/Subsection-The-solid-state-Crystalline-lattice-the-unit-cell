The structure of crystalline solids is periodic. The term does not refer to periodic in time, but in periodic in space. Hence, the structure of crystalline solids is the result of the repetition of a small piece of the structure in the space. The overall structure is called \emph{crystalline lattice}. Here an example of a very simple two dimensional lattice. In this lattice, the central box is repeated infinitely in two directions of the space generating a lattice.
As the lattice is made of repetition, the smallest repeating unit is called the \emph{unit cell}. Therefore, simply with the unit cell one can generate the whole crystal lattice by repeating the unit cell in the tree dimensions. Therefore, it is unnecessary to study the crystalline whole lattice  as the unit cell is enough to understand many properties of crystalline solids such as their density. In the following we will study in more detail the properties of crystalline solids and some of the most common unit cells.
