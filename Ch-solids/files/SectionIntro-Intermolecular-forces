Atoms in liquid or solid compound are connected by means of chemical bonds, and bonds are forces within molecules. This bonds can be ionic or covalent depending on the nature of the elements that form the molecule. At the same time, the molecules of a liquid or solid compound interact with each other by means of intermolecular forces. The word intermolecular means between molecules. This section describe the three existing types of intermolecular forces as well as its nature and intensity.
