Atoms in liquid or solid compounds are connected through chemical bonds, and bonds are forces within molecules. These bonds can be ionic or covalent depending on the nature of the elements that form the molecule. At the same time, the molecules of a liquid or solid compound interact with each other through intermolecular forces. The word intermolecular means between molecules. This section describes the three existing types of intermolecular forces as well as their nature and intensity.
