Molecules are made of atoms which connect by means of \emph{intra}molecular interactions such as covalent or ionic bonds. Differently, molecules interact with each other by means of \emph{inter}molecular interactions. The prefix \emph{inter} means "occurring between", whereas the prefix \emph{intra} means "occurring within". Intermolecular forces are responsible for the melting and boiling point of a chemical. On one hand, the stronger the forces the higher the melting and boiling point. On the other hand, the more intermolecular interactions the higher the melting and boiling point. This is because in order to melt or boil a chemical we need to overcome the intermolecular forces that connect molecules in order to release the into a different state of matter. In the following we will describe the three main types of intermolecular forces (some books describe four types of intermolecular forces counting the ion-molecule interaction).
