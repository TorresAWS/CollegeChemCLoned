iWhat makes solids unique in comparison to liquids and gases? They answer is their structure. There are two main different types of solids: crystalline solids and amorphous solids. Crystalline solids are made of atoms or molecules periodically, regularly, arranged in the three dimensions of the space. Examples of a crystalline solid are table salt or sugar. Amorphous solids have disordered structures. An example of an amorphous solid is window glass. This section will focus on the properties of crystalline solids as their periodicity makes their properties easier to study.
