Compare the boiling point of these two molecules: \ce{HCl} and \ce{H2O}.

\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Let us build a table with the different types of intermolecular forces present in each liquid. The molecules of both liquids can interact by means of dispersion forces and also dipole-dipole forces, as both are polar molecules. Differently, only molecules with a  \ce{H-F}, \ce{H-N} or \ce{H-O} bond can interact by means of hydrogen bonds. For these reason,  \ce{H2O} liquid contains  hydrogen bonds.\\
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{
    >{\centering}m{.185\linewidth} 
    *{2}{Y} }
  \toprule
 & \ce{HCl}    &\ce{H2O}    \\
    \midrule
   Dispersion & 	\checkmark &	\checkmark	  		   \\
  D-D&  \checkmark	 &	\checkmark	 	     \\
      H-bonds & 	\xmark  &\checkmark 		   		\\

\end{tabularx}
Hence, water will boil at a higher temperature.
