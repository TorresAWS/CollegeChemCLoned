We want to build up a galvanic cell based on the reactions below.  
\begin{center}\ce{	Cr^{3+} +e^-	 <=>	Cr2+ 	}\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ} =-$0.42V\\
\ce{	AgO_{(s)} + 2H+ +e^-	 <=>	Ag+ + H2O		 }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ} =+$1.77V\end{center} 
Indicate:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item the anodic and cathodic reactions
\item the balanced overall redox
\item the number of electrons flowing 
\item the overall voltage of the cell
 \end{inparaenum}
