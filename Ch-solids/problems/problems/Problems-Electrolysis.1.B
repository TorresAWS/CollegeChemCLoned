We plate the following metals with an ionic solution of the same metal. Indicate how many seconds will it take to plate the objects using a 25A current:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item 3 moles of \ce{Au^{+}}    %11578s   	 
\item 5 moles of \ce{Ag^{+}}    %19297s   	 
\item 1 moles of \ce{Sn^{2+}}    % 7719s  	 
 \end{inparaenum}
