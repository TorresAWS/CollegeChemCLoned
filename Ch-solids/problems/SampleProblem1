\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
All molecules can interact by means of dispersion forces. Differently, only polar molecules can interact by means of dipole-dipole forces. Finally, only molecules with a  \ce{H-F}, \ce{H-N} or \ce{H-O} bond can interact by means of hydrogen bonds. For these reason, from the table only \ce{HCl},  \ce{H2O} and \ce{CH3Cl} has dipole forces, and only \ce{H2O} has hydrogen bonds.

Indicate what types of intermolecular forces exist in the following molecules: \ce{NH_3}, \ce{HF}, and \ce{CH_3-CH_3}.
\begin{flushright} Answer: all have dispersion, only \ce{NH_3}, \ce{HF} has dipole and only \ce{NH_3}, \ce{HF} has H-bonds.\end{flushright}
