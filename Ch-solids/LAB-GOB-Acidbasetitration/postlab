% PROBLEM 1
\item You need to prepare a sample containing 0.20 g of \ce{CuSO4} from a solution that is 10.\% \ce{CuSO4} by mass. What mass of solution do you need?\vspace{3cm}

\item A 10.00 mL sample of aqueous \ce{HNO3} requires 20.00 mL of 0.201 M NaOH to reach the endpoint. Calculate the molarity of \ce{HNO3}. \vspace{3cm}

\item You titrate a vinegar sample--an acetic acid solution in water--with 0.30 M \ce{NaOH}. Using 10. mL of vinegar, you reach the endpoint after adding 10. mL of the base. Indicate the molarity of the acetic acid solution.
