The goal of this experiment is to calculate the \textit{molar concentration} of a sample of acetic acid by means of a standard chemical procedure known as \begin{it}titration\end{it}. In order to do that you will react the weak acid with a basic solution of sodium hydroxide (\ce{NaOH}), which has a known concentration. You will also use phenolphthalein as an \begin{it}indicator\end{it}.
