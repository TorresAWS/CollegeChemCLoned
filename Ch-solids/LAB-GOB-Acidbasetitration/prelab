\item A 10.00 mL sample of aqueous HCl requires 31.00 mL of 0.0900 M NaOH to reach the endpoint. What is the molar concentration of HCl. The equation for the reaction is:\\
\begin{center}\ce{HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H2O}\end{center}\vspace{3cm}
\item The molarity of a vinegar solution is 0.90 M. Calculate the number of acetic acid moles in 10. mL of this solution. Write down your result using scientific notation.\vspace{4cm}

\item  Nitric acid (\ce{HNO3}) is an acid with three protons. Suppose you titrate 5.00 mL of of this acid with \ce{NaOH} 0.10 M. Knowing that the end point is reached after 25.00 mL of the base is added, find the molarity of the acid solution.\vspace{4cm}
