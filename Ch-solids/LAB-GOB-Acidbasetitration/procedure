\begin{steps}
      \newstep[] Obtain a 5 mL glass-pipet and a 50 mL buret with a stand and buret clamp.
    \newstep[] Obtain about 30 mL of acetic acid solution (vinegar) in a 50 mL beaker and about 80 mL of the NaOH solution in a clean, dry Erlenmeyer flask. Keep the NaOH solution containing Erlenmeyer closed with a rubber stopper. 
    \newstep[] Clean your buret and fill it with the NaOH solution using a plastic funnel. 
    \newstep[] Record the initial volume in the buret as 0mL. Read accordingly to the tool precision, including your significant or estimated value.
  \newstep[] Pipet 5.00 mL of acetic acid into a clean 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask that has 20 mL of distilled water and 2 drops of phenolphthalein. 
       \newstep[] Record the molarity of the NaOH solution (c$_b$) indicated in the lable of the stock solution bottle. This value will be the same for all experiments.
       \newstep[] Place the flask under the buret. Use a piece of white paper under the flask to distinguish better the color change.
       \newstep[] Add the NaOH solution from the buret in 1 mL portions, while swirling the solution in the flask. 
       \newstep[] The titration is completed when an addition of 1 mL causes the color to change from colorless to any shade of pink. Record the final buret volume.
              \newstep[] Repeat the steps above four times and average the resulting acetic acid concentration.
              \newstep[] Make sure you dispose of the solutions and leftovers in the corresponding disposals.

\vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries Calculations }\\
\mycircled{1} Record the initial volume of the buret. This value is not necessarily 0.00 mL.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{2} Record the final volume of the buret, after you reached the end point.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{3} The volumen of \ce{NaOH} used should be: $\mycircled{2} \: - \: \mycircled{1}$ \vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{4} You can calculate the molarity of the acetic acid solution by means of:
\[c_a=\frac{\mycircled{3} \: \cdot c_b}{\text{5 mL}}\]
where $c_b$ is the given molarity of the \ce{NaOH} solution found in the bottle.\\
\mycircled{5} Is the average of the 4 concentrations calculated. \[\frac{\sum{\mycircled{4}}}{4}\]
