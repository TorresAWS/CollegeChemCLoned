\item[\docfilehook{Molar mass review}{}] 
Remember that the molar mass (also known as molecular weight, MW. Atomic weight for the atoms, AW) of a chemical is a property used to convert grams into moles. For example the molar mass of \ce{H2O} is $18g/mol$. If we need to convert 12 grams of water into mols we should do:
 \begin{equation*}
12  \cancel{\text{g of \ce{H2O}}} \times 
\dfrac{\text{moles of \ce{H2O} }} { 18\cancel{\text{ g of \ce{H2O}}} } 
=\text{0.66 moles of \ce{H2O}}
\end{equation*}
In order to use the stoichiometric coefficients from a chemical reaction, the starting quantity must be the moles of a reactant of products. This is because these coefficients are expressed in moles and hence in order to operate with them you can only use moles.
