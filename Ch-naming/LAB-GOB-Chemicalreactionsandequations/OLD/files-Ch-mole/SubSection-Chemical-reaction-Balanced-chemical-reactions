Chemical reactions contain molecules, which are made of atoms. Some chemical reactions are balanced, and others need to be balanced. In order to identify a balanced reaction, you should use the stoichiometric coefficients and the indexes in the molecular formulas to break down the reactants and products into atoms. In a balanced chemical reaction, the atoms of reactants should be the same as the atoms of the products. Consider the following reaction, \\
\begin{center}\ce{2Mg(s) + O2(g) -> 2MgO(s)}.\end{center}
The table below shows all reactants and products in the form of atoms. 
\begin{center}\begin{tabularx}{0.5\linewidth}{XXX}

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\ce{2Mg(s) + O2(g) -> 2MgO(s)} } \tabularnewline

    \ce{O2}=2O &  2O &\checkmark \tabularnewline

\end{tabularx}\end{center}
The number of Mg atoms in the reactants and products is the same, and equals to two. On the other hand, the number of O atoms in the reactants and products is the same, being equal to two. For this reason, we say this reaction is \emph{balanced}.\\
Now consider the following reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{C(s) + O2(g) -> CO(g)},\end{center}
The number of C atoms in the reactants and products is the same, and equals to one. In contrast, the number of O atoms in the reactants and products is not the same, and for this reason, we say this reaction is \emph{not balanced}.

\multicolumn{3}{c}{ \ce{C(s) + O2(g) -> CO(g)} } \tabularnewline

\toprule

  \ce{O2}=2O &  O & \xmark \tabularnewline
