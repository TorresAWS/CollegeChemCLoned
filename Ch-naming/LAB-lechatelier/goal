The goal of this laboratory is to see the shift in the \textbf{equilibrium position} and to connect the observations to \textbf{Le Ch\^atelier's Principle}, which states that:
\begin{center}
 \textit{\emph{Any change in status quo prompts an opposing reaction in the responding system.}}
\end{center}
