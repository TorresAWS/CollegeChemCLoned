A double arrow in a chemical reaction indicates that the reaction can proceed in both directions. Products can react with each other to generate the original reactant. 
\begin{align*} 
 A  + B &\rightleftharpoons   C + D
\end{align*}
Since the speed of most reactions depends on the concentration of the combining species, the forward reaction rate will decrease when products are formed, and the reverse reaction rate will increase. The latter will replenish the concentration of reactants which in turn will accelerate the forward reaction. Eventually, forward and backward reaction rates will equal each other and the concentrations of reactants and product will remain constant; at this point, the equilibrium has been reached.

\section*{The experiment}

The experiment today is divided into the following parts: colored complexed ions (\ce{FeSCN^{2+}}), colored complexed ions (\ce{Ni(NH3)6^{2+}}), the effect of pH on an indicator, effect of pH on solubility, and heat as a product.

 
\subsection*{Part A. Colored complexed ions; \ce{FeSCN^{2+}}.}

Many metals form colored complex ions with several ligands, such as iron (III) ion \ce{Fe^{3+}} with thiocyanate \ce{SCN}:

\begin{align*} 
\textcolor{orange}{\ce{Fe^{3+}} \:(aq)}+ \ce{SCN-}\:(aq)  &\rightleftharpoons  \textcolor{red}{\ce{FeSCN^{2+}}\:(aq)}\\
\textrm{\textcolor{orange}{yellow}} \hspace{20 mm} &\hspace{10 mm} \textrm{\textcolor{red}{red}}
\end{align*}

The Iron (III) solution is yellow, the thiocyanate is transparent and the Iron (III) thiocyanate is red. The final color of the solution will be determined by the concentrations in the final equilibrium position.

\subsection*{Part B. Colored complexed ions; \ce{Ni(NH3)6^{2+}}}.

In the case of Hexaaminenickel (II), you will also study the change in equilibrium position when adding an acid. The ligand will act as a base reacting with the acid and detaching from the metal.

\begin{align*} 
\textrm{\textcolor{teal}{green}} \hspace{25 mm} & \hspace{10 mm} \textrm{\textcolor{blue}{blue}}\\
\textcolor{teal}{\ce{Ni^{2+}}\:(aq)}+ 6\: \ce{NH3}\:(aq)  \rightleftharpoons  &\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{\ce{Ni(NH3)6^{2+}}\:(aq)}}\\
&\hspace{2 mm} \Downarrow \\
&\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{\ce{Ni(NH3)6^{2+}}\:(aq)}}+ 6\:\ce{HCl}\:(aq) \rightleftharpoons  \textcolor{teal}{\ce{NiCl2}\:(aq)} + 6\:\ce{NH4Cl}\:(aq)\\
&\hspace{10 mm}\textrm{\textcolor{blue}{blue}} \hspace{30 mm}  \textrm{\textcolor{teal}{green}}
\end{align*}


\subsection*{Part C. Effect of pH on an indicator.}

pH indicators are substances that change color depending on the medium pH. Typically they are weak bases or acids. As such, they dissociate slightly in water forming ions. Those ions might be colored species. The general expression for the dissociation of a divalent weak acid indicator (H2In) is:

\begin{center} 
 \ce{	$\underset{\textcolor{yellow}{\text{yellow}}	 }{\textcolor{yellow}{\ce{	H2In_{(aq)}}	}}$ + H2O 		\rightleftharpoons		$\underset{\textcolor{red}{\text{red}	 }}{\textcolor{red}{\ce{	HIn^-_{(aq)}	}}}$	+ H3O^+}

\end{center}

In the case of Methyl orange, the protonated form is red, while the conjugated base is yellow. Notice that hydronium is a product in this equilibrium. How will adding an acid affect this equilibrium?

\subsection*{Part D. Effect of pH on solubility.}

Hydroxide salts of Group II elements (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are slightly soluble. Adding acid will neutralize the hydroxides in the solution while adding more hydroxide will increase the ion product. In both cases, the amount of precipitate will be affected.

\begin{align*} 
\ce{Ca(OH)2}\: (s)  \rightleftharpoons \ce{Ca^{2+}}\:(aq) + &\ce{OH-} \:(aq)\\
&\hspace{2 mm} \Downarrow \\
&\ce{OH-}\:(aq)+ \ce{H+}\:(aq) \rightleftharpoons  \ce{H2O}\:(aq)
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Part E. Heat as a product}

Lastly, you will experience Le Ch\^atelier's Principle in an exothermic reaction, where the heat can be viewed as a product of the reaction.

\begin{align*} 
 \textcolor{violet}{\ce{CoCl4^{2-}}\:(aq)} + 6\:\ce{H2O}\:(l) &\rightleftharpoons  \textcolor{red}{\ce{Co(H2O)6^{2+}} \:(aq)}+ 4\:\ce{Cl-}\:(aq)  + \textbf{HEAT}\\
\textrm{\textcolor{violet}{violet}} \hspace{20 mm} &\hspace{10 mm} \textrm{\textcolor{red}{pink}}
\end{align*}
