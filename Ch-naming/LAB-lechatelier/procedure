\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Find 3 test tubes and a 100 mL beaker, clean them, and mark the test tubes with letters A, B, and R.
	\newstep[] Read the Good Lab Practice box
  \import{\chapterlabel/}{goodlabpractice}
	\newstep[] Add about 20 mL of distilled water to the beaker, 20 drops of 0.1 M \ce{Fe(NO3)3} and 20 drops of 0.1 M \ce{KSCN}. Mixed the solution until the color is homogeneous. 
	\newstep[] Use a 10 mL graduated cylinder to add 3 mL of the mixture to each of the test tubes.
	\newstep[] Add 20 drops of 0.1 M \ce{Fe(NO3)3} to test tube A. Put a stopper and mix the solution.
	\newstep[] Add 20 drops of 0.1 M \ce{KSCN} to test tube B. Put a stopper and mix the solution.
	\newstep[] Add 20 drops of distilled water to test tube R. Put a stopper and mix the solution.
	\newstep[] Compare the color of the test tubes A and B to R and write down your observations.
\end{steps}	
\subsection*{Part B. Colored complexed ions: \ce{Ni(NH3)6^{2+}}.}

\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Obtain 1 test tube and clean it.
	\newstep[] Add 10 drops of 0.1 M \ce{Ni(NO3)2}. Indicate the color on the results page.
	\newstep[] Add drops of 6 M \ce{NH3} until the color changes. 
	\newstep[] Add drops of 6 M \ce{HCl} until the color changes.

\end{steps}	
\subsection*{Part C. Effect of PH on an indicator.}
\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Obtain two 50 mL beakers, clean them, and mark them with letters A (for Acid) and B (for Base). Find and clean a test tube.
	\newstep[] Add 10 mL of distilled water to each beaker and 1 mL of distilled water to a test tube.
	\newstep[] Add 4 drops of 6 M \ce{HCl} to beaker A and stir it (this is the diluted acid). 
	\newstep[] Add 4 drops of 6 M \ce{NH3} to beaker B and stir it (this is the diluted base). 
	\newstep[] Add 4 drops of the indicator (methyl orange) to the test tube.
	\newstep[] Add 2 drops from the diluted acid in beaker A to the test tube. Mix gently the solution. Record the color on the results page.
	\newstep[] Drop by drop, add the diluted ammonia solution from beaker B until the color changes. Homogenize the solution from time to time. Write down the number of drops.
	\newstep[] Attempt one more time for another color change by adding drop-by-drop diluted acid solution. Warite down the number of drops.

\end{steps}	

\subsection*{Part D. Effect of pH on solubility.}
	\begin{steps}
    \newstep[] Add 5 mL of 6 M \ce{NaOH} to a 50mL beaker using the graduated cylinder.
    \newstep[] Rinse a 10mL cylinder with water 3 times. Then, use it to add 5 mL of 1 M \ce{Ca(NO3)2} to the beaker.
    \newstep[] Stir the mixture.
    \newstep[] Make a cone with filter paper and place it in a funnel, on top of the Erlenmeyer. Filter the solution with the precipitate. Carry out a couple of washings with distilled water to make sure you collect all solids. Transfer with a spatula the white solid to a small clean beaker.
    \newstep[] Add 10 mL of distilled water to the beaker with the white solid. Stir the mixture. Do not expect the solid to completely dissolve. The solution is saturated.
    \newstep[] Add drops of 6 M HCl until a change is observed. Record your results.
    \newstep[] Add drops of 6 M NaOH until a change is observed. Record your results.
\end{steps}
	
\subsection*{Part E. Heat as a product.}
\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Obtain a Bunsen burner, a stand, two iron rings, a wire gauze, two 250 mL beakers, and a test tube.
	\newstep[] Prepare the setup for the bunsen burner, using the second iron ring to protect the beaker from falling. Put about 100 mL of distilled water in the beaker and bring the water to a boil.
	\newstep[] Add 5 drops of 0.1 M \ce{Co(NO3)2} to the test tube. 
	\newstep[]Record the color of the liquid solution after each step.
	\newstep[] Add drops of 12 M \ce{HCl} until the color of the solution changes. You might need to stir the test tube to help mix the reagents.
	\newstep[] Add 5 drops of distilled water and mix.
	\newstep[] Place the test tube in the boiling water and wait for another color change.
	\newstep[] Attempt to reverse the reaction by placing the test tube in a beaker with ice or cold water.
