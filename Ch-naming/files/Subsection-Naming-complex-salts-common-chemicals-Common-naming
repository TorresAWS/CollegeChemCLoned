\item[\docfilehook{Common naming}{}] 
Some of the chemicals are normally referred by a common name that does not involve the use of any chemical naming rules. An example would be \ce{H2O} normally referred as water instead of its standard name that is dihydrogen oxide. You can find more names in Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter}. Another example:\\
 \begin{namingbox} {}
 \ce{NaCl} \hfill Sodium chloride ({\small standard name})\hfill  Table salt ({\small common name})  
\end{namingbox}
