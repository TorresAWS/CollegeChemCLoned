\item[\docfilehook{Naming Hydrosalts}{}] 
Hydrosalts are related to oxosalts (e.g. \ce{Na2SO4}) and they resemble these chemicals while having hydrogen atoms in their chemical formula, in between the oxosalt cation and anion (e.g. \ce{NaHSO4}). That is the reason they are called hydrosalts as they are oxosalts with hydrogen. For example, \ce{NaHSO4} is named sodium monohydrogensulfate. In order to understand this name, we will first focus on the second part on the name, monohydrogensulfate that represents the hydrosalt anion.
The name monohydrogensulfate (\ce{HSO4^{-}}) comes from adding a proton (\ce{H^+}) to a sulfate cation (\ce{SO4^{2-}}). Mind that protons (\ce{H^+}) are positively charged and therefore if we add a single \ce{H^+} to a sulfate cation (\ce{SO4^{2-}}) the charge will have to decrease a single unit, giving us \ce{HSO4^{-}}. As we can see, the name of hydrosalt anions are directly related to the oxosalt anion and the number of hydrogens in the hydrosalt name. For example, phosphate (\ce{PO4^{3-}}) is an oxosalt anion whereas hydrogenphosphate (\ce{HPO4^{2-}}) and dihydrogenphosphate (\ce{H2PO4^{-}}) are both hydrosalt anions. An explanation about the charges: as phosphate has three negative charges, hydrogenphosphate has to have one less charge (that is $2-$) and dihydrogenphosphate hast to have two less negative charges (that is $-1$). Some final hydrosalt anions examples:
 \begin{namingbox} {}
  \ce{CO3^{-2}}\hfill carbonate ({\small oxosalt})	\hfill   \ce{HCO3^{-}}\hfill monohydrogen carbonate ({\small hydrosalt})\\
    \ce{BO3^{-3}}\hfill borate ({\small oxosalt})	\hfill   \ce{H2BO3^{-}}\hfill dihydrogen borate ({\small hydrosalt}) 
\end{namingbox}
Above we saw how to name just the ending of the hydrosalt. Now we can move forward to the naming of hyrdrosalts. We just need to add the name of the element in the first place, and for example \ce{NaH2BO3} would be named sodium dihydrogenborate. If the first ion--the cation--is a transition metal cation (a type two cation) we need to include in parenthesis the valence of the cation. For example, \ce{Fe(H2BO3)2} would be named iron(II) dihydrogenborate. More examples:
 \begin{namingbox} {}
  \ce{Na2CO3}\hfill sodium carbonate 	\hfill   \ce{NaHCO3} \hfill sodium monohydrogen carbonate ({\small hydrosalt})\\
%    \ce{Mn3(BO3)2}\hfill Manganese(II) borate 	\hfill   \ce{Mn(H2BO3)2}\hfill Manganese(II) dihydrogenborate ({\small hydrosalt}) 
\end{namingbox}
