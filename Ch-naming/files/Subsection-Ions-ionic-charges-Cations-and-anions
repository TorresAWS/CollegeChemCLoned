 Atoms that lose electrons become positively charged. These ions are called cations. Examples of cations are \ce{Li+} or \ce{Mg^{2+}} called lithium cation and magnesium cation, respectively. Atoms that gain electrons become negatively charged, as electrons have a negative charge. These ions are called anions. Examples of anions are \ce{F-}  called fluoride or \ce{N^{3-}} called nitride. The way to name anions is by using the name of the element and the suffix -ide.
