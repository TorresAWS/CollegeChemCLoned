Imagine you cool down a balloon at a fixed volume. What would happen to the balloon's pressure? Based on Gay-Lussac's law, its pressure will decrease:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\frac{V} {T}=c \quad or \quad   \frac{P_1} {T_1}=\frac{P_2} {T_2}} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Gay-Lussca's law}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P_1, T_1$   are the initial pressure and temperature
 \item $P_2, T_2$   are the final pressure and temperature
   \item $c$   is a constant
\end{where}
