\item[\docfilehook{Oxidation states of oxoacids}{ }] Consider the following set of acids: \ce{HClO}, \ce{HClO2}, \ce{HClO3} and \ce{HClO4}. We say \ce{Cl} in these acids have different oxidation state or different oxidation number. This section will cover the calculation of the oxidation state of the central atom of an oxoacid. \\
Let us address the oxoacid: \ce{H\underline{Cl}O3}. The goal is to calculate the oxidation number of the underline element, \ce{Cl}. In order to do this we will follow a set of simple rules. First, we will use the valences as the oxidation number of the elements to the right and to the left of the central atom. Then, we will assign an unknown oxidation state of $x$ to the central atom. After that we will set up a equation so that the sum of all oxidation numbers equals to the charge of the acid, if any. In this formula, we will include the atomic coefficients. In the case of \ce{H\underline{Cl}O3}, the equation would be:
\[1+x+3\cdot (-2)=0\]
as the number of oxygens is three, we will have to time by three the valence of oxygen. The number zero results from the charge of the acid. If we solve for x, we obtain: $x=5$. That is, the oxidation state of \ce{Cl} on \ce{H\underline{Cl}O3} is $5$ and this is represented as\ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{V}}O3}.
