Consider the following set of acids: \ce{HClO}, \ce{HClO2}, \ce{HClO3} and \ce{HClO4}. We say \ce{Cl} in these acids have different oxidation states or different oxidation numbers. This section will cover the calculation of the oxidation state of the central atom of an oxoacid. \\
Let us address the oxoacid: \ce{H\underline{Cl}O3}. The goal is to calculate the oxidation number of the underlined element, \ce{Cl}. To do this we will follow a set of simple rules. First, we will use the valences as the oxidation number of the elements to the right and the left of the central atom. Then, we will assign an unknown oxidation state of $x$ to the central atom. After that, we will set up an equation so that the sum of all oxidation numbers equals the charge of the acid if any. In this formula, we will include the atomic coefficients. In the case of \ce{H\underline{Cl}O3}, the equation would be:
\[1+x+3\cdot (-2)=0\]
as the number of oxygens is three, we will have to time by three the valence of oxygen. The number zero results from the charge of the acid. If we solve for x, we obtain $x=5$. That is, the oxidation state of \ce{Cl} on \ce{H\underline{Cl}O3} is $5$ and this is represented as\ce{H\underline{Cl\textsuperscript{V}}O3}.
