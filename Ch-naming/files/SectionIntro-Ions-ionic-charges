Atoms gain and loose electrons to produce ions. An ion is just an atom with a positive or negative charge. Ions result from an electron transfer. Positive ions have lost negatively charged electrons, whereas negative ions have gained electrons. The reason for this electron transfer is that atoms try to achieve a very stable electronic configuration with eight electrons in the valence, and this is called the octet electron configuration. Examples of ions are: \ce{H+}, \ce{Ca^{2+}} or \ce{O^{2-}}. This section covers the properties of ions and the ionic charges.
