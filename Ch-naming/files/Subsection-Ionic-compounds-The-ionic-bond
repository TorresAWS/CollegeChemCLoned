\item[\docfilehook{The ionic bond}{ }] Atoms of an ionic compound are connected by means of an ionic bond. In an ionic bond, one element gives away electrons (the cation) and the other one receives electrons (the anion). As an example, in the \ce{NaCl} molecule Na gives away an electron to Cl and the molecule results from the combinations of \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Cl^+}. In an ionic compound the element on the left is positive and the one on the right is negative.
