\item[\docfilehook{Ionic charges: the valences}{}] How do we know that hydrogen produces a \ce{H+} ion and nitrogen a \ce{N^{3-}} anion. The charge of an ion is called ionic charges, and the numbers are coming from the periodic table. H, Na or K are in the group IA (left of the table) and hence the ionic charge will be $1+$.  Similarly, Mg or Ca are in the group IIA (left of the table) and hence the ionic charge will be $2+$. Differently, F, Cl or Br are in the group 7A (right of the table) and its charge will be $1-$. Oxygen is in group 6A (right of the table) and the ionic charge will be $2-$. Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter} contains all ionic charges. What if the element is not in this list such as the case of Iron (Fe)? In that case, very probably it will have several ionic charges and this charge has to be indicated in the chemical name. An example would be \ce{Fe}, which ionic charge is not in Figure \ref{fig:naming2}  as iron can have several ionic charges.
