Imagine you cool down a balloon at a fixed pressure (under the atmosphere). What would happen to the balloon's volume? Based on Charle's law, its volume will decrease:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\frac{V} {T}=c \quad or \quad   \frac{V_1} {T_1}=\frac{V_2} {T_2}} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Charle's law}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $V_1, T_1$   are the initial volume and temperature
 \item $V_2, T_2$   are the final volume and temperature
   \item $c$   is a constant
\end{where}
