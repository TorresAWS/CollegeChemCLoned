First and foremost, to carry out a linear regression, you need a graphing calculator. In general, Casio calculators are very user-friendly and easy to use. Differently, Texas calculators tend to be hard to employ. Here I will show how to carry out a linear regression displaying the correlation coefficient $r^2$ parameter on the screen first using a Casio calculator and then using a Texas calculator.
You need to follow the following steps to carry out a linear regression in a Casio fx 9750GII:
\begin{solutionbox} \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf}   Enter the data: start the calculator and press menu+2 (stat) to access the list menu. You will follow all the steps on this menu. Type the X values in List 1 and Y in List 2. 
 \item \begin{bf}Step two:\end{bf} Press Calc (F2) on the bottom menu of the screen, then press Reg (F3) to press $X$ (F1) and then $ax+b$ (F1).
\item \begin{bf}Step three:\end{bf} At this point, you will have all the results from the regression on the screen.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solutionbox} 
You need to follow the following steps to carry out a linear regression in a TI 84:
\begin{solutionbox} \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf} Enter the data: press Stat and Enter. Type the X values in List 1 and Y in List 2.  
 \item \begin{bf}Step two:\end{bf} Press Second and Zero to access the catalg. Now, go down the menu until you find DiagnosticOn and select it.
 \item \begin{bf}Step three:\end{bf} Now carry out the regression by pressing Stat and Calc. Now go down on the menu until you find $ax+b$ and press it.
\item \begin{bf}Step four:\end{bf} At this point, you will have all the results from the regression on the screen.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solutionbox}
