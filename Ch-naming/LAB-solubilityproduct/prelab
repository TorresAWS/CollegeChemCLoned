\item In the experiment, you will react potassium iodate with calcium nitrate to produce a precipitate. Indicate the name of the precipitate formed:

\item In this experiment the iodate (\ce{IO3^-}) and iodide ions (\ce{I^-}) react to produce molecular iodine (\ce{I2}) in acidic medium. Hence, in this redox reaction, a reactant is converted into products by simultaneous oxidation and reduction reactions. This type of redox reaction is referred to as disproportionation. Balance the corresponding disproportionation reaction.

\item In this experiment thiosulfate (\ce{S2O3^{-2}}) is used in a redox titration. This compound reacts with molecular iodide (\ce{I^-}), which has a reddish-brown color, to produce the ion colorless iodide (\ce{I2}) and tetrathionate. Hence, when all thiosulfate is finished along with the titration the reaction becomes colored. Balance the corresponding redox reaction in acidic medium.

\item Both reactions in the previous questions happen consecutively during the experiment. In the redox titration, first iodate reacts with iodine to produce iodine, which also reacts with thiosulfate to produce iodine. Combine both reactions to generate the overall reaction happening in the titration.

\item You need 25mL of sodium thiosulfate 0.01M to reach the equivalency point in the titration of a 10mL sample of iodate. Using the balanced reaction from the previous question, carry stoichiometric calculations to calculate the molarity of iodate in the solution.
