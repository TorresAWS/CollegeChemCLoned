\subsection*{Part A: Preparation of a saturated solution}
\begin{steps}
\newstep[] If your instructor assign you an unknow you can skip Part A.
\newstep[] In a 150mL beaker mix 50mL of a 0.2M \ce{KIO3} solution and 20mL of a 1M \ce{Ca(NO3)2} solution. Make sure you pick the reagents with the indicated concentration as in the lab there could be more diluted potassium iodate. Stir the resulting mix with a stirring rod. A precipitate will appear.
\newstep[]  Using gravity filtration (use a filter funnel and not a B\"uchner funnel), filter the precipitate. Make sure you rinse the beaker with water, to collect all precipitate leftovers.
\newstep[] Wash the precipitate on the filter paper with three different volumes of water.
\newstep[] Use a spatula to separate the precipitate into two halves. Dispose of each part in a clean labeled 100mL beaker. Put one of the beakers aside to be used in case of an accident. Use the other beaker in the rest of the experiment. If you do not use the first half of the precipitate, dispose of it at the end of the experiment following your instructor's indications.
\newstep[] Add 40mL of distilled water to the beaker containing the precipitate. Use a stirring rod to stir the mixtures. 
\newstep[] This is the saturated solution. Let this solution rest for 30 minutes, occasionally stirring.
\newstep[] It is important not to add additional water to this solution.
\end{steps}

\subsection*{Part B: Standardization of thiosulfate: mixture preparation}
\begin{steps}
\newstep[] Locate the \ce{KIO3} solution and write down its molarity in the results section.
\newstep[] Prepare a diluted \ce{KIO3} solution by pipetting 5mL of the \ce{KIO3} solution into a 100mL volumetric flask and fill up with distilled water.

\newstep[] Pipet 10mL of the diluted \ce{KIO3} solution prepared in the previous step into a 125mL (or 250mL) Erlenmeyer flask. First, add 20mL of distilled water from a cylinder. Add 20 drops of 2M HCl and the equivalent of 1mL of solid KI, measured with a 10mL cylinder. Mind you can approximately measure the volume of a solid with a cylinder. Finally, add 40 drops of a 0.2\% starch solution. Swirl the mixture to obtain a homogeneous mixture. 
\newstep[] Repeat the previous step two more times, preparing a total of three Erlenmeyers containing the iodate mixture.
\end{steps}

\subsection*{Part B: Standardization of thiosulfate}
 \begin{steps}
 \newstep[] Ask your instructor of the thiosulfate solution is already standarized. If so, you can skip Part B.
 \newstep[] Rinse a buret with a small portion of \ce{Na2S2O3} solution, discarding the solution used in the rinses.
\newstep[] Fill a buret with \ce{Na2S2O3} solution.
\newstep[] Titrate one of the iodate samples samples adding increments of 1mL of sodium thiosulfate at a time. Swirl the mixture after each addition. You will have reached the equivalency point when the solution becomes colorless. Try placing the flask containing the analyte on a piece of paper. The white background will help see the color change when it occurs.
\newstep[] Write down the volume of thiosulfate added to reach the equivalency point to the nearest 0.01mL. This will give an estimate of the volume needed to reach the endpoint.
        \newstep[] After having estimated the volume of titrate needed to reach the endpoint, we will now speed up the titration by rapidly titrating the second thiosulfate sample.
\newstep[] Add thiosulfate (\ce{Na2S2O3}) to a second iodate sample, stopping 3mL before the estimated endpoint.
        \newstep[] Add \ce{Na2S2O3} drop by drop until you reach the endpoint and the solution becomes colorless. Record the buret reading to the nearest 0.01mL.
        \newstep[] Repeat the titration with the last iodate sample.
\end{steps}



        \subsection*{Part C: Preparing three mixtures of the saturated solution}
\begin{steps}
\newstep[] The goal now is to prepare three samples of an acidified, saturated solution containing iodide. To do this we will first filter the saturated solution to eliminate the solid. After that, we will add acid and iodine to an exact volume of this solution.
\newstep[] Filter the saturated solution obtained earlier in the experiment. Make sure the funnel and the paper are dry. Do not wash the precipitate with water. The filtrate is the solution to be titrated.
\newstep[] Rinse a 10mL pipet with distilled water making sure the pipet is free of water at the end. Now rinse the same pipet two times with a small amount of the filtrate collected in the previous step (2mL), discarding the solution from the pipet.
\newstep[] Pipet 10mL from the filtrate into a 125mL (or 250mL) Erlenmeyer flask. First, add 20mL of water distilled water from a cylinder. Add 20 drops of 2M HCl and the equivalent of 1mL of solid KI, measured with a 10mL cylinder. Mind you can approximately measure the volume of a solid with a cylinder. Finally, add 40 drops of a 0.2\% starch solution. Swirl the mixture to obtain a homogeneous mixture. 
\newstep[] Repeat the previous step two more times to prepare a total of three mixtures.
\end{steps}

\subsection*{Part D: Titration of the saturated solution mixtures: trial titration }
\begin{steps}
\newstep[] The final goal here is to calculate the molarity of the saturated solution, which corresponds to the solubility of the insoluble compound. Here we will estimate the equivalence point of the titration of sodium thiosulfate and sodium iodate.
\newstep[] Rinse a buret with a small portion of \ce{Na2S2O3} solution, discarding the solution used in the rinses.
\newstep[] Fill a buret with \ce{Na2S2O3} solution.
\newstep[] Titrate one of the samples adding increments of 1mL of sodium thiosulfate at a time. Swirl the mixture after each addition. You will have reached the equivalency point when the solution becomes colorless. Try placing the flask containing the analyte on a piece of paper. The white background will help see the color change when it occurs.
\newstep[] Write down the volume of thiosulfate added to reach the equivalency point to the nearest 0.01mL. This will give an estimate of the volume needed to reach the endpoint.
\end{steps}


\subsection*{Part D: Titration of the saturated solution mixtures: exact titration}
\begin{steps}
        \newstep[] After having estimated the volume of titrate needed to reach the endpoint, we will now speed up the titration by rapidly titrating the second thiosulfate sample.
\newstep[] Add thiosulfate to a second sample of saturated solution, stopping 3mL before the estimated endpoint.
        \newstep[] Add \ce{Na2S2O3} drop by drop until you reach the endpoint and the solution becomes colorless. Record the buret reading to the nearest 0.01mL.
        \newstep[] Repeat the procedure with the last saturated sample.
