\vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 1. Solubility rules}
The goal of this mini experiment is to test the solubility rules and predict the soluble character of a chemical.
\begin{steps}[resume]
\newstep[] Find a spot plate. Arrange in the following order the set of reactants Type A:  \ce{NaCl(aq)}, \ce{Na2SO4(aq)} and \ce{Na3PO4(aq)}. Arrange in the following order the set of reactants Type B:  \ce{Ca(NO3)2(aq)} and \ce{AgNO3(aq)}.
\newstep[] Make mixtures of each pair of compounds listed in the results table by adding 2-3 drops of each solution in the same spot of the spot plate. When the resulting mixture is cloudy that means a precipitate has formed. 
\newstep[] Write down the result on the Results table as soluble (S) or insoluble (I).

 \end{steps} 
     

 


 \vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 2. Change of solubility with temperature}
The goal of this mini experiment is to investigate the change of solubility of \ce{KNO3} with temperature. You will do so by adding different amounts of solute and measuring the temperature at what the solute dissolved. You will work in different teams and each team will share their results with the rest of the class.
\begin{steps}
    \newstep[]  You will be assigned an amount of solute between 3 and 7 grams. Weight the solid and write down exactly how much solute did you use. If for example you are assigned 3g you can weight 3.1g.
        \newstep[]  Measure 5mL of water with a measuring cylinder. Add the liquid and the solid to a test tube that should be damped to a stand inside a water bath. Use a thermometer and start warming up the water bath.
          \newstep[]  Heat the solution with either a hot plate or a Bunsen burner until the solid dissolves completely. If you use a hot plate, make sure you secure the beaker with a ring. At that point, stop the heating and take the tube out of the bath keeping the thermometer inside the solution. When crystals start to appear, write down the temperature of the solution. You can calculate solubility in $g\cdot mL^{-1}$ using the formula:
          \[\text{Solubility}=\frac{\text{mass of \ce{KNO3}}}{\text{5 mL of \ce{H2O}}}\times 100\]
           \newstep[] When you have all results from the class, plot solubility (vertical axis) vs. temperature (horizontal axis).
       \end{steps}
