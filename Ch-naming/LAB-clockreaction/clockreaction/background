The rate law expresses the progress of a chemical reaction in function of the concentration of the reactant
\begin{center}  
Rate = $k$[A]$^a$[B]$^b$,
\end{center}
where $k$ is the proportionality constant called the \textbf{rate constant}, [A] and [B] are the respective concentrations for reactants A and B, and the exponents are the \textbf{orders of the reactants}, a way to establish their corresponding relevance in the reaction rate.

\subsection*{Initial rates method}

The initial rates method is used to measure the rate for a chemical reaction and to find out the rate constant $k$ and the order of the reactions. This method is based on the assumption that at the beginning of a chemical reaction, there is no reverse reaction, i.e. forming reactants from the products, can take place, and therefore the rate is solely affected by the reactants concentrations. The time for the reactant concentrations to change by the same amount is measured. Several experiments are carried out using all the same starting concentrations but for one reactant. The beauty of this experiment is the method used to make the reactant's concentration change by the same amount for all the experiments. This is probably the most often misunderstood part of this laboratory and it is key to understand it thoroughly.

\subsection*{The Iodine Clock}

A watch system is a method used in the Navy to schedule regular periods aboard. A ship's bell is used to indicate the end of each period, allowing the crew to know when it is time to switch their task, take breaks, or have lunch. 

A \textbf{chemical clock} is a chemical reaction with a sudden change in one of its properties, the tempo of which can be adjusted by adjusting the concentrations. The \textbf{iodine clock} is a chemical clock marked by a sudden, almost magical, color change. For the present experiment, the iodine clock will be connected to the reaction being studied and will indicate the moment our reaction reaches the change in concentration desired. It is very important to understand the mechanism of the two competing reactions involved in this experiment to fully understand this activity.

The reaction setting the time is:
\begin{align*} 
 \ce{I2}(aq) + 2\:\ce{S2O3^{2-}}(aq) &\longrightarrow  \ce{S4O6^{2-}}(aq) + 2\:\ce{I-}(aq)\\
\end{align*}

This reaction consumes iodine, \ce{I2}. Iodine reacts with starch turning the solution dark. The starch will be used in this experiment in a way similar to the indicator used in titration.
\begin{align*} 
\textrm{starch with iodine}\hspace{22 mm} &\hspace{28 mm} \textrm{starch , no } \ce{I2}\\
\textbf{\ce{starch} + \ce{I2}}(aq)  + 2\:\ce{S2O3^{2-}}(aq) &\longrightarrow  \ce{S4O6^{2-}}(aq) + 2\:\ce{I-}(aq) +\ce{starch}\\
\textrm{black-dark blue} \hspace{22 mm} &\hspace{28 mm} \textrm{transparent}\\
\end{align*}

The iodine clock reaction will be running in parallel with another reaction that produces iodine. In the presence of starch, iodine becomes dark blue, almost black. Therefore, as long as there is thiosulfate (\ce{S2O3^{2-}}) in the beaker the iodine will react with the latter and keep the solution transparent. We could say that the timer is adjusted by the concentration of thiosulfate (\ce{S2O3^{2-}}).

\subsection*{The reaction to be studied}

In this experiment, the student will determine the reaction rate of the reduction of potassium persulfate (\ce{K2S2O8}) with sodium iodide (\ce{NaI}).

\begin{align*} 
\ce{K2S2O8}(aq) + 2\:\ce{NaI}(aq) &\longrightarrow 2\:\ce{Na2SO4}(aq) +\ce{I2}(aq)\\
\end{align*}

As ionic compounds dissociate in aqueous solutions it is more accurate to write the \textbf{net ionic equation}. These are the ionic net equations for the two reactions, the reduction of potassium persulfate with sodium iodide and the iodine clock:

\begin{align*} 
\ce{S2O8^{2-}}(aq) + 2\:\ce{I^-}(aq) \longrightarrow 2\:\ce{SO4^{2-}}(aq) + &\textbf{\ce{I2}(aq)}\hspace{10 mm}\leftarrow\textrm{\textit{rate to be measured}}\\
&\hspace{2 mm} \Downarrow \\
\textrm{\textit{iodine clock}}\rightarrow\hspace{10 mm}&\textbf{\ce{I2}(aq)} + 2\:\ce{S2O3^{2-}}(aq) \longrightarrow  \ce{S4O6^{2-}}(aq) + 2\:\ce{I-}(aq)\\
\end{align*}

To summarize: The first reaction will be running producing \ce{I2}, which would turn dark blue in the presence of starch. However, the second reaction will avoid the color change by reducing the iodine into iodide. The solution will remain transparent as long as there is thiosulfate (\ce{S2O3^{2-}}) available. Once the thiosulfate is finished, iodine will finally remain in the solution turning it dark blue. Since the amount of thiosulfate will be constant for all the experiments to be performed, the amount of iodine produced in the first reaction, and therefore the reactant's concentration change, will be the same each time the solution turns dark. The iodine clock is being used to schedule a constant change in the reactant's concentrations.

\section*{The experiment}

The experiment today is divided into the following parts: obtaining the reaction rate constant, evaluating the influence of the temperature on the reaction rate, and evaluating the influence of a catalyst on the reaction rate.
 
 
\subsection*{Part A. Obtaining the reaction rate constant.}

The reaction to be studied and its rate law are:
 
{\flushleft \ce{K2S2O8_{(aq)}  + 2 NaI_{(aq)}   -> 2 Na2SO4_{(aq)}  + I2_{(s)}} \hspace{5cm} r = k [\ce{S2O8^{2-}}]$^a$ [\ce{I^-}]$^b$}
 

Using the \textbf{initial rates method} the reactants orders, $a$ and $b$, can be solved. Find the suitable combinations of experiments where only one initial concentration of \ce{S2O8^{2-}} or \ce{I^-} changes and compare the rates using a fraction. The initial concentrations must be recalculated using the volumes and their original concentrations. Once the reactant orders are known and the initial concentrations of \ce{S2O8^{2-}} and \ce{I^-} for each reaction have been recalculated, the reaction constant, $k$, can be solved. See the example for more details:

\subsection*{Parts B. Evaluating the influence of the temperature on the reaction rate.}

According to \textbf{Arrhenius equation}, the rate constant is affected by the temperature following the equation:

\[k=Ae^{-E_a/RT}\]

where $A$ is a constant, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.
A higher temperature would make the negative exponent smaller, and therefore the $k$ would be greater. In other words, an increase in the temperature should accelerate the reaction.
It is possible to calculate the activation energy by measuring the reaction rates at two different temperatures. After calculating the respective rate constants these are compared in their logarithmic forms:
\[\textrm{ln}(k)=-\frac{E_a}{RT}+\textrm{ln}(A)\]
After subtracting the expression above for both temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$, the following equation is generated:
\[\textrm{ln}\Bigg(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\Bigg)=\frac{E_a}{R}\Bigg(\frac{1}{T_1}-\frac{1}{T_2}\Bigg)\]
The values of $k_1$ and $k_2$ obtained respectively at $T_1$ and $T_2$ are used to calculate $E_a$. The temperatures should be given in Kelvins since $R$ = 8.3145 J/K mol.

\subsection*{Part C. Evaluating the influence of a catalyst on the reaction rate.}

A catalyst is a substance that without being consumed, accelerates the reaction. The catalyst generates a new reaction path with a lower activation energy. Looking at the Arrhenius equation, the effect of lowering the activation energy works in the same way as an increase in temperature. The catalyst used in this experiment will be copper sulfate (\ce{CuSO4}). The Cu(II) cations are responsible for the catalytic effect.
