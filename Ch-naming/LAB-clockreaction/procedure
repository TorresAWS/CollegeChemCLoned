\subsection*{Part A. Obtaining the rate law. Mixing the test tubes}

\begin{steps}

\newstep[] Now you are about to start up the reaction. It is critical to follow the steps below.
	\newstep[]  Every reaction should be done in \textbf{
the same way} to be comparable. The same steps, in the same order and at the same pace should be followed.
\newstep[] You will be adding \ce{K2S2O8}. After adding the \ce{K2S2O8}, the test tube should be closed with the stopper, and the content should be mixed by inverting the test tube 16 times. Do not rush, turn the test tube \textit{Mississippily}. Do the same for the following reactions.
  \import{\chapterlabel/}{cautionbox}

\end{steps}

\subsection*{Part A. Obtaining the rate law. Starting the reaction}


\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Obtain about 25 mL \textbf{0.20 M \ce{K2S2O8}} in a small beaker. Make sure you do not contaminate the bottle of reagent by alwaysÂ retrying out of the bottle into a beaker and never pipetting directly from the bottle. Clean and rinse the pipette with \ce{K2S2O8}.
 	\newstep[] Get test tube 1 and a stopper. Set the time to zero.
	\newstep[]  Start the stopwatch as you pipette 2.0 mL of \ce{K2S2O8} in test tube 1. Time should start to be measured as soon as you add the first drop of \ce{K2S2O8} in a test tube. Mix the reaction as explained above. \newstep[] Stop the stopwatch when the solution turns dark. The color will appear suddenly. If more than 5 minutes elapse without the solution turning dark, start doubting about what have you mixed.
\newstep[] Repeat the previous steps now for test tube 2  and pipetting this time 4.0 mL of \ce{K2S2O8} into the test tube.
.\newstep[] Repeat one more time the previous steps now for test tube 3 and pipetting this time 2.0 mL of \ce{K2S2O8} into the test tube.
	\newstep[] Now you need to repeat all steps above (mixture preparation and reaction) to do a second trial for the three test tubes.
\newstep[] Discard the solutions in the indicated waste container and clean the test tubes.
\end{steps}



\subsection*{Part B. Evaluating the influence of the temperature on the reaction rate.}
\begin{steps}

	\newstep[] Label three large test tubes with the letters ``\textbf{T}'', ``\textbf{C}''' and ``\textbf{K}'''. ``T'' stands for ``Temperature'', ``C'' for ``Catalyst'' and ``K'' for ``\ce{K2S2O8}''.
	\newstep[] Add to test tubes ``T'' and ``C'' the same volumes of \ce{NaI}, \ce{NaCl}, \ce{Na2S2O3}, Starch and \ce{K2SO4} as for test tube 1. Do not add the \ce{K2S2O8} yet. Reserve test tube ``C'' in the rack for Part C.
	\newstep[] Add about 5 mL of \ce{K2S2O8} to test tube ``K''.
	\newstep[] Obtain a 600 mL beaker and, with the help of the thermometer, add hot and cold water until you have about 400 mL of water between 40 and 45 degrees Celsius.
	\newstep[] Place the test tubes ``T'' and ``K'' in the hot water bath and allow them to temper for at least 5 minutes. Part C can be done during those 5 minutes. .
	\newstep[] Measure the temperature of the water after the tempering time. Write down this temperature in the results table. Start the reaction by pipetting 2 mL of \ce{K2S2O8} from test tube ``K'' into test tube ``T''. After the 16-Mississippi mixing, return the test tube to the bath and wait to record the time it takes for the solution to turn dark.	
	\end{steps}

\subsection*{Part C. Evaluating the influence of a catalyst on the reaction rate.}
\begin{steps}

	\newstep[] Add \textbf{one drop} of \textbf{0.2 M \ce{CuSO4}} to test tube ``C''. Shake the test tube to mix the solution.
	\newstep[] Start the stopwatch as you pipette 2.0 mL of \ce{K2S2O8} in the test tube. Mix the reaction as explained above.
	\newstep[] Record the time it takes for the solution to turn dark.
