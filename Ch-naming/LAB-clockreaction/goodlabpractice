       \item Pipettes are always used together with a suction bulb or a syringe. \textbf{Never} such a chemical using the mouth!
	\item \textbf{Never} leave a pipette laying on the table \textbf{while connected to the syringe}. Remaining liquid can leak into the syringe. The syringe will be damage and the liquid will return contaminated to the pipette.
       \item Always wash pipettes with distilled water and rinse them using the same product to be measured. Such a small volume, disconnect the syringe and move the liquid about displacing the distilled water. Discard the rinsing liquid as waste. Rinse twice.
