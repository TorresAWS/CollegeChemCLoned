The goal of this mini-experiment is to identify the polarity of a given solute by mixing it with a polar and nonpolar solvent. To chemicals with the same polarity will mix with each other due to favorable interactions. Think about oil and soap, both are nonpolar chemicals and hence they mix well. Differently, chemicals with different polarity do not mix well. Think this time about water and oil. Water is polar and oil is nonpolar. Both chemicals do not mix well. By using a polar solvent (water) and a nonpolar solvent (cyclohexane) you will be able to track the polarity of a given solute by studying the miscibility of the solute with both solvents. Ultimately, polarity is due to differences in electronegativity an the existence of a permanent dipolar moment in the molecule. Small molecules (diatomic) made of different elements will always be polar, as the differences of electronegativity will not compensate with each other leading to a permanent dipole moment. Molecules made mainly of C and H will normally be nonpolar as both elements have not appreciable electronegativity differences.
\begin{steps}
    \newstep[] Use eight test tubes in a rack. Four of these will be filled with 5 drops of water--a polar solvent--whereas the remaining four tubes will be filled with cyclohexane--a nonpolar solvent.
    \newstep[] Add a few drops of a few crystals of the following solutes both in water and in cyclohexane. If the solute mixes with water that means it will be polar. If the solute mixes with cyclohexane that would mean it is nonpolar.
\end{steps}


 




 

\vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 2. Electrolytes}
In this mini-experiment you will study the electrolyte character of a series of solutes with different nature. By means of two electrodes connected to a lightbulb you will be able to appreciate the degree these chemicals conduct electricity. If the lightbulb glows the chemical will be an electrolyte. Depending on the brightness of the glow the chemical will be a strong or weak electrolyte.



\begin{steps}
    \newstep[] You or the professor will use a setup with two electrodes connected to a lightbulb. Place 20mL of the different solutions in the table below in a beaker.
        \newstep[]  Lower the electrodes to the solution and observe the glow.
        \newstep[]  Observe the glow and classify the chemical as nonelectrolyte, strong electrolyte or weak electrolyte.
\end{steps}

\vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 3. Molarity of a solution}
The goal of this mini-experiment is to calculate the molarity of an already prepare solution. In order to calculate molarity, we need the moles of solute and the volume of solution. You will take a given solution volume by using a pipet. At the same time you will learn how to use a pipet--a very common chemistry measuring tool. Then you will evaporate the solution so that only the solute will remain. By weighting this solute and given the molar mass you will convert grams into moles and compute molarity.
\begin{steps}
  \newstep[] Fill a 250mL beaker with 200mL of water. Set the beaker on a hot plate and start heating at medium high heat. 
      \newstep[] Weight an evaporating dish. Write down the mass in the table below.
 \newstep[] Place the evaporating dish on top of the beaker so that it receives indirect heat. Use a metallic ring to secure the beaker.
 \newstep[] Use a small beaker to measure approximately 20mL of the unknown solution. Use a 10-mL graduated pipet to transfer exactly 10mL of the solution into the evaporating dish. Weight the evaporating dish with the solution.
  
   \newstep[] The solution will start to dry. When the evaporating dish is completely dry, stop the heater and wait for the dish to cool down. Weight the evaporating dish with the solute.
    
\end{steps}



Calculate the molarity of the solution by using the following formula:
\begin{equation*}
M=\frac{n_{solute}}{v_{solution}}
\end{equation*}
