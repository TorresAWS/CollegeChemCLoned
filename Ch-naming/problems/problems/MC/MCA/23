A metallic nugget with a mass of 19 g \FPeval{\mass}{19} is added to 150.0 mL \FPset{\vol1}{150} of water.  The water level rises to a volume of 151.0 mL\FPset{\vol2}{151}. What is the density of the metal in g/mL?\FPeval{\density}{ round(  \mass/ (\vol2 -\vol1), 1) }
 %A metallic nugget with a mass of 50 g is added to 150.0 mL of water.  The water level rises to a volume of 151.0 mL.  What is the density of the metal in g/mL?
 %A metallic nugget with a mass of 5 g and density of 5g/mL is added to 150.0 mL of water.  What is the final water level in mL?
%A metallic nugget with a mass of 19 g is added to container with water. Given than the density of the metal in 19g/mL, calculate the raise on the water level in mL?
