\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Name or formulate the following hydrates:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  Nickel(II) permanganate dihydrate   % 
\item  Sodium nitrate monohydrate   % 
\item \ce{Na2CO3 . 10H2O}
\item \ce{MgSO4 . 7H2O}
\end{inparaenum}
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The formula for Nickel(II) permanganate  is \ce{Ni(MnO4)2}, therefore the formula for Nickel(II) permanganate dihydrate is \ce{Ni(MnO4)2 . 2H2O}. The formula for Sodium nitrate is  \ce{NaNO3}, therefore \ce{NaNO3 . H2O} is Sodium nitrate monohydrate. The name for \ce{Na2CO3 . 10H2O} is sodium carbonate decahydrate and \ce{MgSO4 . 7H2O} is magnesium sulfate heptahydrate.
