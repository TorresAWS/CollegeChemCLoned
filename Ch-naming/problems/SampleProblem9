\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Name or formulate the following hydrosalts:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  Magnesium hydrogensulfate   % 
\item  Sodium hydrogen carbonate  % 
\item \ce{LiHCO3}
\item \ce{Mg(H2PO4)2}
\end{inparaenum}
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The formula of Magnesium hydrogensulfate   is \ce{Mg(HSO4)2} as the formula for monohydrogen sulfate is  \ce{HSO4^-} and the valence of magnesium is \ce{Mg^{2+}}. The formula for Sodium monohydrogen carbonate is \ce{NaHCO3} as it results from combining \ce{Na^+} and \ce{HCO3^-}. Mind monohydrogen carbonate results from adding a hydrogen ion \ce{H^+} to a carbonate \ce{CO3^{2-}} ion. The name for   \ce{LiHCO3}  is lithium monohydrogen carbonate, whereas the name for \ce{Mg(H2PO4)2} is magnesium dihydrogenphosphate.
