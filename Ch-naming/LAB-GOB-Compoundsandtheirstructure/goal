This experiment will go over the ideas of molecular geometry and bond-hybridization. On one hand, you will learn how to predict the geometry of a molecule and how to differentiate, for example, a linear molecule from a bent molecule. Also you will learn to predict the hybridization of atomic orbitals involved in a chemical bond.
