\subsection*{Part A: Background measurement}
    \begin{steps}
        \newstep[] Obtain a Geiger counter. Turn it on and let it warm up for five minutes.
        \newstep[] Start the Geiger counter. Set up the measurement time to 60 seconds and the measuring voltage according to your professor's instructions. Mind to select a voltage of 900V for all measurements (Press Display/High Voltage/Up/Down until you reach 900V). Press measure (press Display until the light cursor is next to count; then press Count until the stop button lights up.) and write down the background radioactivity in counts per minute in the table below.
        \newstep[] Measure the background radiation by reading the meter 10 times. 
          \newstep[]  Compute the average activity and standard deviation.
    \end{steps}        
\subsection*{Part B: Calculation of $t_{1/2}$ for a set of mass measurements}
 
        
          \begin{steps}  
     \newstep[] Weight between 10 and 11 grams of KCl in a scale. Write down your measurement. Place the sample in a 100mL beaker.
    \newstep[] With the help of a stand, clamp the counter as close a possible to the sample but without touching the sample. Be very careful with the membrane at the end of the counter as it is very delicate and tears easily.
            \newstep[] Set up the measurement time to 60 seconds and the measuring voltage according to your professor's instructions. Mind to select a voltage of 900V for all measurements (Press Display/High Voltage/Up/Down until you reach 900V). Press measure (press Display until the light cursor is next to count; then press Count until the stop button lights up.) and write down the activity in counts per minute in the Results section.
            \newstep[] Measure radiation by reading the meter 10 times.

        \newstep[] Repeat Part A for a set of K masses between: 14-15g, 19-20g, and 24-25g.
        \newstep[] For each sample compute the average activity $\overline{A}$ in cps and the number of 40-K atoms in the sample, $N$.
        \newstep[] Plot $\overline{A}$ in cps in the vertical axis versus $N$ in the horizontal axis. 
         \newstep[] Compute the half-life for each mass measurement with its average.
          \newstep[] From the slope of your plot calculate the half-life of the isotope.
            \newstep[] Compare the calculated half-lives with the experimental value.
             \end{steps}
