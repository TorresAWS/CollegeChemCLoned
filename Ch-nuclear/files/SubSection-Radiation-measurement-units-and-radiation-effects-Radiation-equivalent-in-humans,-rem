Not all radiations have the same impact on the human body. The radiation equivalent in humans takes into account the different types of radiation in order to adjust the biological damage of radiations. the rem is the number of rads times a factor that depends on the radiation. This factor is one for beta and gamma radiation, being 20 for alpha particles.
