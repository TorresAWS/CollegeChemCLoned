So if the half-life is the time it takes for a radioisotope to decompose in half, what would happen after several half-lives? For example, imagine we have 20 grams of iridium-131 with a half-life of 8 days. When we prepare or hypothetically unseal the sample, we will have 20 grams of \ce{^131 Ir}. After one half-life (8 days) we'll have 10 grams of \ce{^131 Ir}. After two half-lives (16 days), we'll have 5 grams of \ce{^131 Ir}. Similarly, after three half-lives (22 days), we'll have 2.5 grams.
