Radioisotopes--atomic isotopes that produce radiation--are written as \ce{^A_ZX}. For example, \ce{^14_6C} is referred to as carbon-14. The number on the top is the mass number $A$, that is represented the total number of neutrons and protons in the isotope. The number on the bottom refers to the atomic number $Z$, that is, the total number of electrons in the atom. For example, the mass number of \ce{^14_6C} is 14 whereas its atomic number is 6. \ce{^14_6C} has 14 neutrons and protons and 6 electrons.
