Certain isotopes decay by producing a positron, that is, they produce  \ce{^0_{+1}e}  particles on its decay. A nuclear reaction that produces \ce{^0_{+1}e} is called positron emission. In a positron emission, the emitter has the same mass number $A$ as the product isotope. However, its atomic number $Z$ increases by one unit.
\[ \text{Emitter} \longrightarrow \text{ \ce{^0_{+1}e}} + \text{New isotope} \]
