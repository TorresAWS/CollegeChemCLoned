Isotopes--called emitters--spontaneously decompose producing new isotopes in a process called radioactive decay. In this decay, radiation is also emitted. 
\[ \text{Emitter} \longrightarrow \text{radiation} + \text{New isotope} \]
In the following, we will discuss the most important type of radioactive decay.
