Sometimes one needs to identify an unknown isotope \ce{^A_ZX} in a chemical reaction. This means identifying the name $X$ of the isotope, the atomic number $Z$ as well as the mass number $A$. To do this, we will use the fact that the total mass number as well as the total atomic number should stay constant before and after the nuclear reaction. Let's break this idea down into an example.
