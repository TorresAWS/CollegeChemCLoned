Nuclear fission was discovered in before the second world war when \ce{^235_92U} was bombarded with neutrons. The result is the split of the atom in two different isotopes and the release of more neutrons:
\begin{center}\ce{^1_0n + ^235_92U -> ^141_56Ba + ^92_36Kr + 3^1_0n }\end{center}
This process releases 26 million times more energy than the combustion of methane. As neutrons are produced in a fission process, they can already activate another uranium atom producing more neutrons. This is the essence of a chain reaction: a self-sustained fission process. If less than one neutron causes a new fission process the fission process will stop and the reaction is said to be subcritical. Differently, when exactly one neutron from each fission even produces another fission the process will sustain and the reaction is know as critical. When more than one neutron produced generates a new fission the fission process will escalate and the reaction is known as supercritical. During the World War II, the Manhattan project was a united states research project with the aim to build a bomb based on the principles of fission. A fission bomb operates by suddenly combining subcritical masses of uranium, producing a enormous explosion.
