Large energy quantities are releases when two light isotopes combine to produce a heavier isotope. Nuclear fusion is the mechanism of energy production in the stars. Very high temperatures are required to initiate nuclear fusion and that is the reason why this source of energy has not been exploited in the earth yet. An example of fusion reactions found in the stars are:
\begin{center}\ce{^1_1H + ^2_1H -> ^3_2He }\\
\ce{^3_2He + ^1_1H -> ^4_2He + ^0_1e }
\end{center}
