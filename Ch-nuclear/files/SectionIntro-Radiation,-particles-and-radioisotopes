Light elements have normally stable nuclei. Differently, heavier elements with atomic numbers larger than 20 tend to often have several isotopes--remember these are atoms of the element with a different number of neutrons--that have unstable nuclei. For these unstable isotopes, the forces that keep the nucleus together are not strong enough to stabilize the nuclei. An unstable nucleus is radioactive, which means that it will spontaneously emit radiation in the form of small particles. Not all radioactivity is the same and there exist different types of radiation, which we will address in the following.
