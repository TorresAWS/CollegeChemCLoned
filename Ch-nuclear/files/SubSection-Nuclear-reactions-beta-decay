Other isotopes produce beta radiation, that is, they produce $\beta$ particles on its decay. A nuclear reaction that produces a $\beta$ particle (\ce{^0_-1e}) is called beta decay. In beta decay, the emitter has the same mass number $A$ as the product isotope. However, its atomic number $Z$ decreases by one unit.
\[ \text{Emitter} \longrightarrow \text{\ce{^0_-1e}} + \text{New isotope} \]
