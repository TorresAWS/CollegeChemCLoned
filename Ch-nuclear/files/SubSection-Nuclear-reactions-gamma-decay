Some other isotopes produce gamma radiation, that is, they produce $\gamma$ particles on its decay. A nuclear reaction that produces a $\gamma$ particle (\ce{^0_0\gamma}) is called gamma decay and in this type of decay no new isotope is produced. The emitter that is normally excited--we denote this with a $^\ast$ symbol--just looses energy and becomes more stable. In a gamma decay, the emitter and the product isotope, both have the same mass and atomic number.
\[ \text{Emitter} \longrightarrow \text{\ce{^0_0\gamma}} + \text{New isotope} \]
