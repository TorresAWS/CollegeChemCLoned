Some other isotopes produce gamma radiation in the form of $\gamma$ particles on its decay. A nuclear reaction that produces a $\gamma$ particle (\ce{^0_0\gamma}) is called gamma decay. In this type of decay no new isotope is produced. Gamma emitters are normally excited, that is they have higher energy than normal; we denote this with a $^\ast$ symbol. Exited particles tend to loose energy to become more stable. In a gamma decay, the emitter and the product isotope, both have the same mass and atomic number.
