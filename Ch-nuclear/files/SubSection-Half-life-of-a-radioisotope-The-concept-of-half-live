The half-life of an isotope represented as $t_{1/2}$ is the time it takes for an isotope to disappear reducing the sample mass to half the initial value. For example, $t_{1/2}$ for chromium-51 is 28 days and that means that after 28 days a sample of 1 gram of the radioisotope will indeed weigh 0.5 g. Samples of radioisotopes weigh less and less with time as they decompose producing more stable isotopes. Similarly, $t_{1/2}$ for strontium-90 is 38 years which means that a one-gram sample will take 38 years to reduce its mass to 0.5g. We can use the concept of half-life to compare the speed of decomposition of different radioisotopes. For example $t_{1/2}$ for strontium-90 is 38 years whereas $t_{1/2}$ for chromium-51 is 28 years. Hence, strontium-90 will exist longer than chromium-51.
