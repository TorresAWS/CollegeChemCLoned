The half-life of an isotope represented as $t_{1/2}$ is the time it takes for an isotope to disappear reducing the sample mass to half the initial value. For example, $t_{1/2}$ for chromium-51 is 28 days and that means that after 28 days a sample of 1 gram of the radioisotope will indeed weigh 0.5 g. Table \ref{tab:Table-Halflife} reports half-lives of numerous isotopes. Samples of radioisotopes weigh less and less with time as they decompose producing more stable isotopes. Similarly, $t_{1/2}$ for strontium-90 is 38 years which means that a one-gram sample will take 38 years to reduce its mass to 0.5g. We can use the concept of half-life to compare the speed of decomposition of different radioisotopes. For example $t_{1/2}$ for strontium-90 is 38 years whereas $t_{1/2}$ for chromium-51 is 28 years. Hence, strontium-90 will exist longer than chromium-51. 
The activity of an isotope is indeed its rate of the decomposition $r$ which depends on the amount of radioactive isotope you have in the sample $n$,
\[ r=kn \]
where $k$ is the rate constant for the decomposition. At the same time this rate constant is related to half-life, as decomposition is a first order reaction:
\[t_{1/2}=\frac{0.693}{k} \]
