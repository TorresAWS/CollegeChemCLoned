The half-life of an isotope $t_{1/2}$ is the time it takes for an isotope to disappear reducing the sample mass to half the initial value. For example, $t_{1/2}$ for chromium-51is 28 days and that means that after that time a one gram sample of the radioisotope will weight 0.5 g. $t_{1/2}$ for strontium-90 is 38 years that means that a one gram sample will take 38 years to reduce its mass to 0.5g.
