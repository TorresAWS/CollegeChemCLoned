Some isotopes produce alpha radiation, that is, they produce $\alpha$ particles on its decay. A nuclear reaction that produces an $\alpha$ particle (\ce{^4_2He}) is called alpha decay. In an alpha decay, the emitter decreases its mass number $A$ four units and its atomic number $Z$ two units.
\[ \text{Emitter} \longrightarrow \text{\ce{^4_2He}} + \text{New isotope} \]
