\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{he} field of nuclear medicine was first established in 1934 with the production of artificial radioactive substances. This field uses the power of nuclear chemistry to cure cancer and other diseases or simply to visualize organs. In 1937, the first radioactive isotope was used to treat a person with leukemia at the University of California at Berkeley. Radioactive substances are now used to produce images of organs, such as the liver, spleen, thyroid gland, kidneys, and brain, and to detect heart disease. Today, procedures in nuclear medicine provide information about the function and structure of every organ in the body, which allows the nuclear physician to diagnose and treat diseases early. This chapter covers the basic principles of nuclear chemistry. You will learn the real meaning of radioactivity and how to quantify the effects of radiation or measure the duration of a radioactive chemical.
