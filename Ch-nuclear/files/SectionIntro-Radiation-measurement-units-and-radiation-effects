Beta and gamma radiation can be detected with a  Geiger counter, which consists of a detector tube with a specific ionizing gas. When radiation enters the Geiger counter, it generates charged particles that produce a detectable electrical current. The larger the current the stronger the radioactive source. In the following we will address the different units of radioactivity--activity, adsorbed dose and biological damage--as well as the effects of radiation.
