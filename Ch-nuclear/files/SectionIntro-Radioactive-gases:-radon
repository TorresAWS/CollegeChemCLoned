Radon is a colorless, odorless radioactive gas produced by the radioactive decay of uranium. It is present in nearly all soils and very small levels of radon are found in the air we breathe every day. The problem occurs when radon gas enters our home and gets trapped. If you are breathing in too much radon, you will not feel sick right away. Only long-term exposure to high levels of radon can cause lung cancer and the risk is higher for those who smoke. While questions still remain over the quantities and length of exposure, radon concerns are a fact of homeownership. Most residential real estate transactions require radon testing, and many states require radon mitigation for new construction. The recommended reference radon level is 100 $Bq\cdot m^3$ in dwellings. 
Testing your home for radon is easy and doesn't cost very much. You can test for radon yourself or hire a professional to do it for you. There are relatively simple tests for radon gas. Radon detection devices are commercially available. Digital radon detectors provide ongoing measurements giving both daily, weekly, short-term and long-term average readouts via a digital display. Short-term radon test devices used for initial screening purposes are inexpensive, in some cases free.
