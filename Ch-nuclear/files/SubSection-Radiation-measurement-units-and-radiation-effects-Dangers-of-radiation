Radiation units different than Ci or Bq are used to measure the impact of radiation in humans. The rem (radiation equivalent in humans) is a radiation unit that measures the direct biological effects of different kinds of radiation. The amount of rems a person receives would determine the impact of the radiation on this person\textquotesingle s health. As an example, radiation exposure under 25 rem are harmless and they cannot be detected. If a victim is exposed to 100 rem or higher, the person will suffer the symptoms of radiation sickness, and will feel nausea, vomit, fatigue, and a reduction in white-cell count. If a person is exposed to a dosage greater than 300 rem, that can lower the white-cell count to zero; the victim will suffer diarrhea, hair loss, and infection. Exposure to radiation of about 500 rem is expected to cause death in half of the people receiving that dose. Radiation dosages of about 600 rem would be fatal to all humans within a few weeks.
