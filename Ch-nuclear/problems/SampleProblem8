\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
On one hand, Docetaxel is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer with a half-life of 309600 seconds. On the other hand, Vandetanib is an anti-cancer medication that is used for the treatment of certain tumors of the thyroid gland with a half-life of 1641600 seconds. Which medication will remain longer in the body?
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We will compare the half-lives of both medication using scientific notation to express the numbers so that we can clearly see how the numbers compare. $t_{1/2}$ for Docetaxel is $3.096\times 10^{5}$ seconds, whereas $t_{1/2}$ for Vandetanib is $1.6416\times 10^{6}$ seconds. We have that Vandetanib has a larger half-life and hence it will remain longer in the body.
