\begin{enumerate}

\item If the empirical formula of the solute used in this experiment is \ce{C3H2Cl}, what is the molecular formula? \vspace{3cm}
\item What would be the effect on the molar mass in the following situations? Explain why.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  A decrease in the mass measured for the solute. \vspace{2cm}
\item  An increase in the mass measured for the solute. \vspace{2cm}
\item  Dirt (soluble) from the stopper was added to the solution. \vspace{2cm}
\item  A loss of cyclohexane. \vspace{2cm}
\end{enumerate}
\item How much would the molar mass change if 1.000 g of the cyclohexane evaporates during part B? What would be the induced error? \vspace{3cm}
