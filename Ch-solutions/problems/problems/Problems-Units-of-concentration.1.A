Calculate the molality for: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  a solution made of 5moles of NaBr(MW=103g/mol) in 200g of water % (25m)
\item  a solution made of 20g of NaBr(MW=103g/mol) in 200g of water % (0.97m)
\item  a solution made of 10g of NaBr(MW=103g/mol) in 20mL of water % (4.85m)
 \end{inparaenum}
