Calculate: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  the molarity of a 20\% solution of density 1.1g/mL made of a \ce{Na2SO4}(MW=142g/mol) % (1.55M)
\item  the mole fraction of a 20\% aqueous solution of density 1.1g/mL made of a \ce{Na2SO4}(MW=142g/mol) % (0.03)
\item  the percent by mass of an aqueous solution of density 1.1g/mL and 0.4mole fraction, made of a \ce{Na2SO4}(MW=142g/mol) % (84\%)
