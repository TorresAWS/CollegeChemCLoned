Calculate: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  the molarity of a 0.2m solution of density 1.2g/mL made of a NaCl(MW=58g/mol) % (0.26M)
\item  the molality of a 0.2M solution of density 1.2g/mL made of a NaCl(MW=58g/mol) % (0.27M)
\item  the percent by mass of a 0.1M solution of density 1.2g/mL made of a NaCl(MW=58g/mol) % (0.45/%)
 \end{inparaenum}
