Calculate the mole fraction of solute of a solution: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  containing 3g of solute (MW=16g/mL) and 100g of water % (0.03)
\item  containing 2 moles of solute and 30 moles of solvent % (0.06)
\item  containing 4 moles of solute and 45 moles of solution % (0.09)
 \end{inparaenum}
