The solubility of a gas in water at 298K when its partial pressure is 1.9atm is $2.65\times 10^{-4}$M. Calculate:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  Henry's law constant at that temperature  % ($1.4\times 10^{-4}$ M/atm)
\item  The solubility at a partial pressure of 0.9atm % ($1.2\times 10^{-4}$M)
\end{inparaenum}
