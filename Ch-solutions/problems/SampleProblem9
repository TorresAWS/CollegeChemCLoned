A solution of 0.07M HF--a weak electrolyte--has a osmotic pressure of 2atm at 298K. Calculate:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]	
\item The nominal solute concentration.
\item The effective ion concentration.
\item  The percent dissociation of the acid.
\end{inparaenum}\\
 \textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) The nominal solute concentration is 0.07M.
(b) The osmotic pressure depends on molarity and temperature. We know the temperature, R is 0.082atmL/Kmol, and the vale of the osmotic pressure. With this information we can calculate the effective concentration of particles in solution:
\[i\cdot M=\frac{\pi}{RT}=\frac{2}{0.082\cdot 298}=0.08M\]
This value accounts for the overall concentration of solute particles in the form of molecules and ions.
(c)  The osmotic pressure is related to the effective molarity and given that we know the nominal solute concentration, we can calculate the degree of dissociation of the acid:
\[c^{\text{effective}}=c^{\text{Nominal}}\cdot (1+ (i-1)\frac{\alpha}{100})\]
Plugging the given values we have:
\[0.08=0.07\cdot (1+ (2-1)\frac{\alpha}{100}) \]
We can solve for $\alpha$:
\[ \alpha=100\cdot (0.08/0.07-1)=14.28\% \]
This results indicated that 14\% of the electrolyte dissociates  forming \ce{H^+ + F-}, whereas 86\% stays in the form of \ce{HF}.\\
