Nonelectrolytes do not dissociate in water. Hence a solution of a nonelectrolyte will mostly contain molecules of that electrolyte and not ions. Examples of nonelectrolytes are carbon-based chemicals such as methanol, ethanol, urea or sucrose. The dissociation of urea for example \ce{CH4N2O} proceeds as:
\begin{center}\ce{CH4N2O(s)  ->[H2O] CH4N2O_{(aq)} }\end{center}
For this electrolyte, in terms of solute dissolved and solute particles, we have that one mole of solute dissolved gives one mole of solute particle:
\begin{center}\ce{1 moles of solute dissolved  ->[H2O] 1 moles of solute particles }.\end{center}

Weak electrolytes partially dissociate in water, and on paper, this is indicated by means of a chemical reaction with a double arrow. Hence in a solution of a weak electrolyte you will have both ions as well as molecules of the electrolyte. Examples of weak electrolytes are hydrofluoric acid, water, ammonia or acetic acid. The dissociation of hydrochloric acid (\ce{HF}) proceeds as:
\begin{center}\ce{HF_{(l)}  <=>[H2O] H^{+}_{(aq)} + F^{-}_{(aq)} }\end{center}
Acetic acid (\ce{CH3COOH}) is an important weak electrolyte and its dissociation proceeds somehow in a peculiar way:
\begin{center}\ce{CH3COOH_{(l)}  <=>[H2O] CH3COO^{-}_{(aq)} + H^{+}_{(aq)} }\end{center}

For this electrolyte, in terms of solute dissolved and solute particles, we have that one mole of solute dissolved will give less than two moles of solute particle:
\begin{center}\ce{1 moles of solute dissolved  ->[H2O] $<$ 2 moles of solute particles }\end{center}
