Nonelectrolytes do not dissociate in water. Hence a solution of a nonelectrolyte will only contains molecules and not ions. Examples of nonelectrolytes are carbon-based chemicals such as methanol, ethanol, urea or sucrose. The dissociation of urea for example \ce{CH4N2O} proceeds as:
\begin{center}\ce{CH4N2O(s)  ->[H2O] CH4N2O_{(aq)} }\end{center}
In terms of solute dissolved and solute particles, we have that one more of solute dissolved gives one mole of solute particle:
\begin{center}\ce{1 moles of solute dissolved  ->[H2O] 1 moles of solute particles }.\end{center}
