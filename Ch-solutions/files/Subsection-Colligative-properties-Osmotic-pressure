The pressure of a gas result from the movement of the gas particles as they hit the walls of their container. The higher the hitting frequency the higher pressure. More specifically, the pressure of a gas depends on the force exerted by the gas molecules per unit of container area. Solutions can also exhibit pressure as solute molecules also hit the walls of their container. This pressure is called osmotic pressure. The higher molarity, that is the number of moles per liter in the solution, the higher the osmotic pressure of a solution:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \pi=i\cdot M\cdot RT 	}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation13}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\pi$  is the osmotic pressure of the solution in atm
 \item $M$  is the molarity of the solution
  \item $R$   is the constant of the gases: 0.082 atmL/Kmol
  \item $T $ is the temperature of the solution in K
        \item $i$ is van't Hoff factor of the solute
      \item $i\cdot M$ is the effective concentration of solute particles
\end{where}
The osmotic pressure of solutions is responsible for an effect called osmosis. First, let us talk about what is a semipermeable membrane. These are a type of membranes that allow the pass of solvent molecules without allowing the pass of solute molecules. 
We could set up and experiment in which we separate two solutions of different concentrations by a semipermeable membrane and we will certainly see that the level of liquid on the most concentrated solution will rise, whereas the level of liquid in the most dilute will reduce. 
This effect results from the travel of water molecules from the less to the more concentrated solution equilibrating the osmotic pressure at the semipermeable membrane. 
Solute diffusion normally occurs against the concentration gradient. Solute diffuses from more to the less concentrated solution. The more concentrated solution is referred to as the hypertonic solution, whereas the less concentrated solution is referred to as the hypotonic solution.
Differently, solvent diffusion occurs following the concentration gradient (Low M $\rightarrow$ High M). Osmosis is responsible for many every-day life phenomena such as salting as a method to preserve food: by adding salt one can kill bacteria and preserve fish by extracting the water from their inside.
