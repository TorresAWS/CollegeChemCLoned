The pressure of a gas results from the movement of the gas particles as they hit the walls of their container. The higher the hitting frequency the higher pressure. More specifically, the pressure of a gas depends on the force exerted by the gas molecules per unit of container area. Solutions can also exhibit pressure as solute molecules also hit the walls of their container. This pressure is called osmotic pressure, $\Pi$. The higher the molarity, that is the number of moles per liter in the solution, the higher the osmotic pressure of a solution:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \pi=i\cdot M\cdot RT 	}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation13}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\pi$  is the osmotic pressure of the solution in atm
 \item $M$  is the molarity of the solution
  \item $R$   is the constant of the gases: 0.082 atmL/Kmol
  \item $T $ is the temperature of the solution in K
        \item $i$ is van't Hoff factor of the solute
      \item $i\cdot M$ is the effective concentration of solute particles
\end{where}
The osmotic pressure of solutions is responsible for an effect called \emph{osmosis}. First, let us talk about what is a semipermeable membrane. These are a type of membranes that allow the passing of solvent molecules without allowing the passing of solute molecules. 
We could set up an experiment in which we separate two solutions of different concentrations by a semipermeable membrane and we will certainly see that the level of liquid in the most concentrated solution will rise, whereas the level of liquid in the most dilute will reduce. 
This effect results from the travel of water molecules from the less to the more concentrated solution equilibrating the osmotic pressure at the semipermeable membrane. 
Solute diffusion normally occurs against the concentration gradient. Solute diffuses from more to less concentrated solution. The more concentrated solution is referred to as the hypertonic solution, whereas the less concentrated solution is referred to as the hypotonic solution.
Differently, solvent diffusion occurs following the concentration gradient (Low M $\rightarrow$ High M). 
On one hand, osmosis can be prevented by applying external pressure to the most concentrated solution. The minimum pressure that stops the osmosis is the osmotic pressure of the solution. On the other hand, osmotic pressure is regularly employed to experimentally obtain molar masses of soluble solutes. This colligative property is particularly useful on top of the others as small molarities cause relatively large osmotic pressures.
