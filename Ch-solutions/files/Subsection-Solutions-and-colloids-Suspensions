Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures. The particles of a suspension are so large that they can often be visually seen and they can be trapped using filters and membranes. Because of its weight, suspended particles tend to segregate and settle out on the bottom of suspensions. Examples of suspensions are antacid mixtures or liquid penicillin.
