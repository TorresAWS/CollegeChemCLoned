The molarity of a solution is directly related to the number of moles of solute molecules in the solution. However, the osmotic pressure of a solution depends on the number of moles of ions and not the number of moles of solute molecules. The osmolarity (Osm) is defined as the number of osmoles per liters of solution, being the number of osmoles the number of moles times the number of particles on solution $i$:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ Osm=i\cdot M  	}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation18}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $M$  is the molarity
 \item $i$  is the number of ions produced per mole of solute
\end{where}
For example, the osmolarity of a 2M \ce{NaCl} solutions would be 4Osm as \ce{NaCl} contains two ions ($i=2$).
