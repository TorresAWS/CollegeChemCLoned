One can find gas, liquid, or solid solutions depending on the final phase of the resulting solutions. For example, brass is a solid solution of copper and zinc and the air is a gaseous solution of oxygen, nitrogen, and other components. Solutions can be classified in terms of solubility. The solubility of a given solute in a solvent is the maximum amount of solute one can dissolve in a volume of solvent. Solutions can be saturated when they contain the maximum amount of solute one can fit, unsaturated when they contain less than the maximum amount of solute one can fit, or supersaturated when they contain more than a saturated solution. Supersaturated solutions tend to be unstable and the solute tends to eventually precipitate.
