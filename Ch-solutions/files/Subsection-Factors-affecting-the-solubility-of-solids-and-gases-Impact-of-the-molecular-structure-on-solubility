The solubility of a solute into a solvent is intimately related to how the molecules of both compounds interact with each other. Polar solutes will tend to dissolve in polar solvents whereas nonpolar solutes will be more soluble in nonpolar solvents. Still, polarity only does not explain why a polar solute is more soluble in some polar solvents than others, and ultimately is the interaction between molecules and the energy associated with this interaction that determines solubility.
