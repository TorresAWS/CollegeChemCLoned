 In solutions, the solute particles are dispersed evenly throughout the solvent giving homogeneous mixtures. As such, in a solution such as seawater, the solute cannot be visually distinguished from the solvent. The mixture appears transparent even when it may have a certain color. The solute particles are so small that they can go through filters and membranes.
