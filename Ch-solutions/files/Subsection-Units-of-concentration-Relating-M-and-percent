We can use the following formula to relate Molarity and percent by mass of solute
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \text{M}=\frac{\%_m \cdot \text{d}\cdot 10}{MW}}
\quad  \text{or }\quad 
\boxed{ \%_m=\frac{\text{M}\cdot MW }{10\cdot \text{d} }}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation8}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item M   is the molarity of the solution
  \item $\%_m$   is the percent by mass of solute
  \item $d$   is the density of the solution 
  \item $MW$   is the molecular weight of the solute 
\end{where}
