Electrolytes--in particular strong electrolytes--dissociate producing ions. This way, a solution of for example \ce{NaCl} does not contain \ce{NaCl} molecules but \ce{Na^+_{(aq)}} cations and \ce{Cl^-_{(aq)}} anions. Hence it is important to correctly break down electrolytes into ions. To do this, you need to revert the combination of ions that produce a given chemical while making sure the charges are balanced. For example, let us beak magnesium chloride \ce{MgCl2_{(aq)}} into ions. This is a strong electrolyte formed by magnesium cations and chloride anions. The valence of magnesium is +II and the valence of chlorine is -I. The \ce{MgCl2} formula also tells us we have one magnesium and two chlorines. The overall process is:
\begin{center}\ce{MgCl2_{(aq)} -> Mg^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2Cl^{-}_{(aq)} }\end{center}
Another example is magnesium nitrate \ce{Mg(NO3)2}. This strong electrolyte--as this is an ionic salt--is made of lithium with valence +I and nitrate with valence -I. The formula indicated we have one \ce{Mg^{2+}_{(aq)}} and two \ce{NO3^{-}_{(aq)}}. Hence:
\begin{center}\ce{Mg(NO3)2_{(aq)} -> Mg^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2NO3^{-}_{(aq)} }\end{center}
