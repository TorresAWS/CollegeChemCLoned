\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}S}{olutions} are homogeneous mixtures of a solvent and one or more solutes. In your everyday life, you will encounter numerous liquid-based mixtures, from recovery drinks to fancy champagne or plain milk. However, solutions are not just liquid-based as you can also find solid solutions such as an alloy, and even gas solutions such as the air. This chapter will cover the physical properties of solutions--boiling, freezing, and melting--and in particular, we will gain insight into the impact of the solute on the physical properties of the solvent. The chapter will also address the meaning of different concentration units and the relationship between them, as well as the properties of colloids--a special type of unstable mixture.
