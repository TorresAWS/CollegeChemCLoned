Chemicals can be classified based on their electrolyte character in strong electrolytes and non-electrolytes. Non-electrolytes do not dissociate in solution so that each non-electrolyte molecules becomes a solute particle. Differently, strong electrolytes dissociate in solution so that each strong electrolyte molecule gives more than one solute particles. This section covers the concept of effective solute particle and the idea of Van't Hoff factor $i$ that related the amount of moles of solute dissolved and the moles of solute particles.
