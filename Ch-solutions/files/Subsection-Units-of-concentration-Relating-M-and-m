We can use the following formula to relate Molarity and molality
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \text{m}=\frac{1000\cdot \text{M}}{1000\cdot d - \text{M}\cdot MW}}
\quad\quad or \quad\quad
\boxed{ \text{M}=\frac{ 1000\cdot m\cdot d   }{1000+MW\cdot m   	}}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation7}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item M   is the molarity of the solution
  \item m   is the molality of the solution
  \item $d$   is the density of the solution 
  \item $MW$   is the molecular weight of the solute 
\end{where}
Mind that this formula only works for water as a solvent and uses 1g/mL as the density of water.
