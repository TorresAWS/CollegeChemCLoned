 Strong electrolytes completely dissociate in water. Hence, in a solution of a strong electrolyte you will only have ions and never molecules. Strong electrolytes are typically ionic compounds such as \ce{MgCl2} or \ce{NaCl} (table salt). We represent the dissociation of a strong electrolyte with a single arrow, meaning that the reaction proceeds to completion and for the example below, in the solution we will only have ions (\ce{Mg^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2Cl^{-}_{(aq)}}) and not molecules (\ce{MgCl2_{(s)}}):
\begin{center}\ce{MgCl2_{(s)}  ->[H2O] Mg^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2Cl^{-}_{(aq)} }.\end{center}
In terms of solute dissolved and solute particles, we have that one more of solute dissolved gives three moles of solute particle:
\begin{center}\ce{1 moles of solute dissolved  ->[H2O] 3 moles of solute particles }.\end{center}
