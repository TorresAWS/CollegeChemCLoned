In numerous applications one needs to compute the molecular weight of a solute by means of a given molality or molarity. It is useful to remember that the molality of a solution is related to the moles of solute and the kilograms of solvent, in contrast to the molarity of a solution that depends on the litters of solution. When we prepare a solution we normally know the mass of solute used and the mass of the solvent or the volume of solution. We can compute the molar mass of the solute by means of:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ MW=\frac{ \text{g of solute}   }{\text{m}\cdot \text{kg of solvent}   	}}
\quad\quad\text{or} \quad\quad\
\boxed{ MW=\frac{ \text{g of solute}   }{\text{M}\cdot \text{L of solution}}}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation17}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item MW   is the molar mass of the solute
  \item $\text{g of solute}$   is the mass of solute
  \item $\text{kg of solvent}$   is the mass of solvent
    \item $\text{L of solution}$   is the volume of solution
  \item $\text{m}$   is the molality of the solution
\end{where}
