We have that solutions are homogeneous mixtures in the form of only one visible phase. If we add an ionic solute to a solvent, the solute particles would break down into ions and these ions would be solvated by the solvent molecules. As such,  the solute in solution exists in a different state than the solid solute. We also have that a heterogeneous mixture would result from mixing sand and water. The particles of sand will suspend on the liquid but eventually, they will deposit on the bottom of the container. Between homogeneous and heterogenous mixtures we have colloids. Colloids are special types of homogeneous mixtures. Colloids are suspensions of two components that are indeed immiscible in a non-homogeneous way. Think for example of milk, that is a colloid containing small particles of fat and protein suspended on a liquid. The particles of fat are called the dispersed phase and the liquid matrix is called the dispersing medium. The suspended particles of a colloid are larger than the particles of a normal homogeneous solution. Also, and perhaps more importantly, the particles of a colloid can be separated and for example, by adding a few drops of lemon to a glass of milk you will be able to separate both the fat and the liquid. In contract, solutions are made of inseparable components and the only way to separate the solvent and solute in a solution is by boiling it. Colloids are named depending on the nature of the dispersed and dispersant phases: aerosols (e.g. fog), foams (e.g. whipped cream), emulsions (e.g. mayonnaise), sols (e.g. milk of magnesia), and gels (e.g. jelly) are just a few examples of different types of colloids. How to differentiate a solution and colloid? The Tyndall effect exposes the differences between solutions and colloids. A focused beam of light can easily pass through a solution as the particles of the solute are smaller than the light wavelength. Differently, when a colloid is exposed to the same light it will be scattered by the dispersed phase of the colloid which has a larger size. Therefore, you will be able to see the bean passing through the colloid. An example of the Tyndall effect is the scattering of light from the car headlights on a foggy day.
