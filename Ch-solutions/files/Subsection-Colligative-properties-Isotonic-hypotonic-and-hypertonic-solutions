The cells in biological systems contain semipermeable membranes. Isotonic solutions--the prefix iso means the same--exert the same osmotic pressure as biological fluids such as blood. In hospitals, most intravenous solutions are made of isotonic solutions. Examples of isotonic solutions are a 5\% NaCl solution or a 0.9\% glucose (\ce{C_6H_{12}O_6}) solution. Both have the same osmolarity of 0.3 Osm. If we place a red blood cell in an isotonic solution it will not experience any changes in its shape as the osmotic pressure inside and outside would be the same. 
Hypotonic solutions--the prefix hypo means lower than--have a lower osmolarity than biological fluids. As such, if we place a red blood cell in a hypotonic solution it will swell and burst as water from the outside will flow inside the cell to compensate for the higher osmotic pressure. This phenomenon is called hemolysis. Differently, hypertonic solutions--the prefix hyper means higher than--have a higher osmolarity than biological solutions. A red blood cell placed in such a solution will shrink as water will flow out of the cell into the solution in order to compensate for the higher osmotic pressure outside the cell. This phenomenon is called crenation.
