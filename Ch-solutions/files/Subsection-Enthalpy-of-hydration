The enthalpy of hydration represents the energy involved in the reaction of an ion with water to produce an hydrated ion. For single ions, this property is impossible to measure directly, as we cannot recreate the process of dissolution of a single ion, those are found in the form of ionic compounds and not separate ions. Still, simulations can give insight into the factors that impact these property. In general terms, the electronegativity of the ion impact hydrations: more electronegative ions tend to have smaller, more negative, hydrations energies.  $\Delta H^{hyd}$ values for numerous solutes are given in Table  \ref{tab:Table-Enthalpy-hydrations}. We can see that $\Delta H^{hyd}$ for \ce{F-} is -524 KJ/mol, while being -308  KJ/mol for \ce{I^-}, a  less electronegative ion.
