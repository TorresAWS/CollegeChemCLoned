The mole fraction of a solute is the ratio of the moles of solute over the moles of solution--that is moles of solute plus the moles of solvent.
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \chi=\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{moles of solute + moles of solvent}}}\label{\chapterlabel:equation3}
\end{equation}
For example, if we mix 0.4 moles of NaCl and 0.6 moles of water, the mole fraction of solute will be 0.4. We can define a similar mole fraction of solvent and both, the mole fraction of solvent and solute should add up to 1.
