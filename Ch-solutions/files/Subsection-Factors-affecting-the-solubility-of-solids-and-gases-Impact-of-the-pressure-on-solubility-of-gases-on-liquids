Pressure does not impact the solubility of solids or liquids in a liquid solvent. However, gas pressure impacts the solubility of a gas solute on a liquid. In particular, the higher pressure the higher solubility. The law that related gas solubility with pressure is called Henry's law:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ s=k\cdot P 	}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation14}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $s$  is the solubility of a gas in a liquid solvent in M units
 \item $k$  is Henry's law constant with units of M/atm
  \item $P $ is the gas pressure in atm
\end{where}
An every-day life application of Henry's law is the production of carbonated beverages. These beverages are produced in contact with a liquid with an atmosphere of \ce{CO2} of typical pressures of 5 atm. When you open a can container, the \ce{CO2} in the drink comes out of the liquid in the form of bubbles to equilibrate the high gas pressure on the liquid and the low gas pressure in the atmosphere.
