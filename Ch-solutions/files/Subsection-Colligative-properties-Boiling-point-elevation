 Solutions are made of a solute dissolved in a solvent. Pure solvents have a specific boiling point. When we made a solution, the solution boils at a different temperature than the pure solvent, and in particular, a solution boils at a higher temperature than the solvent. This effect is called the boiling point elevation of a solution in comparison with the pure solvent. The boiling point elevation does not depend on the nature of the solute and only depends on the molality (m) of the solution using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ T_b^{\text{solution}}=T_b^{\text{solvent}}+k_b\cdot i\cdot m 	}
\quad  \text{or }\quad 
\boxed{\Delta T_b =k_b\cdot i\cdot m}
\label{\chapterlabel:equation10}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $T_b^{\text{solution}}$  is the boiling point of the solution
  \item $T_b^{\text{solvent}}$   is the boiling point of the pure solvent  
  \item $k_b$   is called molal boiling point elevation constant in units of $^{\circ}C/m$
  \item $m$ is the molality of the solution
    \item $i$ is van't Hoff factor of the solute
  \item $\Delta T_b$ is the boiling point increase, that is $T_b^{\text{solution}}-T_b^{\text{solvent}}$
      \item $i\cdot m$ is the effective concentration of solute particles

\end{where}
Mind that $i\cdot m$ represents the effective solute-particle concentration in the solution. For the case of NaCl $i$ is 2 as every NaCl unit dissociates producing 2 ions or two solute-particles. The value of $k_b$ depends on the solvent and in general boiling point increases tend to be modest. For example, a water-based solution containing NaCl boils at a higher temperature than pure water which boils at 100$^{\circ}C$. A 1m NaCl solution boils at 101.04$^{\circ}C$ which is one degree higher than pure water.
The boiling point elevation formula establishes a linear relationship between the boiling point of a solution and molality in which the slope of the relationship is positive and gives the value of $k_b$, the $x$ variable is $m$ and the $y$ variable is $T_b^{\text{solution}}$. In other words, by plotting $T_b^{\text{solution}}$ vs. $m$ we should obtain a straight line with a slope that equals to $k_b$ and an intercept equals to $T_b^{\text{solvent}}$.
