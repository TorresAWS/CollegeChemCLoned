The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \text{m}=\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}}} \label{\chapterlabel:equation5}
\end{equation}
For example, if we mix 5 grams of NaCl and 100 grams (0.1 kg) of water, the molality of the solution will be 50m. The properties molarity and molality are different. In particular, molarity (M) depends on temperature. As the volume of a liquid slightly increases with temperature, molarity decreases with temperature. Differently, molality (m) is temperature independent.
