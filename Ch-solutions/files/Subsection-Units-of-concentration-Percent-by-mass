The percent by mass (or percent by weight) of a solute is the ratio of the grams of solute over the grams of solution--that is grams of solute plus the grams of solvent--multiplied by 100.
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \%_m=\frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solute + mass of solvent}}\times 100}\label{\chapterlabel:equation4}\end{equation}
There is an equivalent concentration measure to the solute percent by mass but based on volume called the solute percent by volume. $\%_v$ is calculated as the ratio of the solute volume and the solution volume in percent form. This percentage is useful when the solute and solvent are both liquids and can be measured in terms of volume.
For example, if we mix 5 grams of NaCl and 100 grams of water, the percent by mass of solute will be 5\%. We can define a similar percent by mass of solvent and both, the percent by mass of solvent and solute should add up to 100.
