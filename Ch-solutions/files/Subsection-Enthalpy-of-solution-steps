We will address here the steps involved in the process of dissolution of a compound in a general solvent such as water. This process involves the disgregation of the molecules of the solute into dissolved particles, that is, particles solvated by the molecules of the solvent. The molecules of the solute and the solvent interact through intermolecular forces. These forces need to play a certain role in dissolution. In the case of the solute, strong intermolecular forces would hinder dissolution and it would take a lot of energy to separate the solute particles. At the same time, once the solute is disgregated into dissolved particles, the energetics involved in the hydration need to play a role as well in dissolution. One might think that particles that do not hydrate easily would be less soluble than particles with a large tendency to be surrounded by water molecules.
This way, we can understand the dissolution process, characterized by the enthalpy of solution ($\Delta H^{soln}$), using three steps: first, the energy involved in expanding the solute into separate entities ($\Delta H^{xp}_{solute}$); second, the energy involved in expanding the solvent into separate entities ($\Delta H^{xp}_{solvent}$); third, the energy involved in mixing the separate solute and solvent particles into hydrated ions ($\Delta H^{mix}$). Overall we have that
\[	\Delta H^{soln}=\Delta H^{xp}_{solute}+\Delta H^{xp}_{solvent} +\Delta H^{mix} \] 
Steps two and three combined represent the energy of hydrating the solute:
\[	 \Delta H^{hydration}=\Delta H^{xp}_{solvent} +\Delta H^{mix} \]
At the same time, the energy of expanding the solute has a clear meaning when the solute is ionic. This is called the negative value of the lattice energy ($\Delta H_{lattice}$), the energy needed to form a solid ionic lattice from the separated ions:
\[	 \Delta H^{xp}_{solute}=-\Delta H_{lattice} \]

Large, positive  $\Delta H^{soln}$  values correspond to endothermic solution processes, that is, the solute would absorb energy when dissolving (e.g. \ce{NH4Cl}). Small, negative  $\Delta H^{soln}$  values correspond to exothermic solution processes, that is, the solute would release energy when dissolving (e.g. \ce{NaCl}).
For the case of \ce{NaCl} we have that the enthalpy of solution is close to 4KJ/mol, while the energy needed to expand the solute is 788KJ/mol (the lattice energy of  \ce{NaCl} is -788KJ/mol. The enthalpy of hydration for \ce{Na^+} is -406KJ/mol and for \ce{Cl^-} is -378KJ/mol.
