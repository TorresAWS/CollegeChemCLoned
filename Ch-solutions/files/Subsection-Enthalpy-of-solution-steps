We will address here the steps involved in the process of dissolution of a compound in a general solvent such as water. This process involves the disgregation of the molecules of the solute into dissolved particles, that is, particles solvated by the molecules of the solvent. The molecules of the solute and the solvent interact through intermolecular forces. These forces play a key role in dissolution. In the case of the solute, strong intermolecular forces hinder dissolution. It takes more energy to separate the solute particles when intermolecular forces in the solute are strong. 
Similarly, for the solvent, intermolecular forces also hinder dissolution. It takes more energy to separate the solvent particles when intermolecular forces in the solvent are strong. Once the solute is disgregated into dissolved particles, the energetics involved in the hydration play a role in dissolution. Particles that do not hydrate easily are less soluble than particles with a large tendency to be surrounded by water molecules.
This way, we can understand the dissolution process, characterized by the enthalpy of solution ($\Delta H^{soln}$), using three steps: first, the energy involved in expanding the solute into separate entities ($\Delta H^{xp}_{solute}$); second, the energy involved in expanding the solvent into separate entities ($\Delta H^{xp}_{solvent}$); third, the energy involved in mixing the separate solute and solvent particles into hydrated ions ($\Delta H^{mix}$). Overall we have that
\[	\Delta H^{soln}=  \Delta H^{xp}_{solute} +\Delta H^{xp}_{solvent} +  \Delta H^{mix} =  \Delta H^{hyd} +\Delta H^{mix} \] 
Steps two and three combined represent the energy of hydrating ($\Delta H^{hyd}$) of the solute:
\[	 \Delta H^{hyd}=\Delta H^{xp}_{solvent} +\Delta H^{mix} \]
At the same time, the energy of expanding the solute has a clear meaning when the solute is ionic. This is called the negative value of the lattice energy ($\Delta H_{lattice}$), the energy needed to form a solid ionic lattice from the separated ions:
\[	 \Delta H^{xp}_{solute}=-\Delta H_{lattice} \]
