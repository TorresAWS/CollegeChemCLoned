As you can see from the equations previously presented here, the vapor-pressure lowering, the freezing-point depression, the boiling-point elevation, and the osmotic pressure are all controlled by the concentration of the solute particles, in terms of molality, molarity, or mole fraction and they are unaffected by the nature of the solute. As such, a 1m \ce{NaCl} solution will experience the same boiling-point increase as a 1m \ce{KCl} solution, even if the solute is different. Colligative properties are associated with the nature of the solvent and the concentration of solute but not the nature of the solute. Furthermore, these formulas work well for very diluted solutions. We call these solutions, in general, ideal solutions.
