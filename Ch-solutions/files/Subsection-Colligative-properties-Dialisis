Dialysis is a process that resembles osmosis in which a semipermeable membrane--referred to as the dialyzing membrane--is used to separate water and small molecules from larger molecules such as proteins. This process indeed occurs in most plant and animal cells, with the difference that these membranes allow the pass not only of the solvent but also of small solutes and ions. This process is also used in artificial kidney machines that purify blood with the help of a cellophane membrane. In this process, a dialyzing solution with the same composition as blood but without any waste product is used to clean up blood. Hence, a movement of waste molecules from the solution cleanses blood.
