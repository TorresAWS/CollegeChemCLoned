The solubility of a solute on a solvent is the maximum amount of solute that one can dissolve in a solvent at a given temperature. The temperature has a strong impact on solubility. However, the nature of the impact depends on the nature and state of matter of the solute.
Normally, the solubility of solids increases with temperature. That means the higher temperature the more solute one can dissolve. However, this trend is not true for all solid solutes. Solid solutes like \ce{Ce2(SO4)3} or \ce{Li2SO4} follow the opposite trend the higher temperature the lower solubility. 
The solubility of gas solutes normally decreases with temperature, that is, the higher temperature the less amount of gas will be dissolved in a liquid. If you warm up a can of soda it goes flat as the gas comes out of the liquid--we call this desorption.
