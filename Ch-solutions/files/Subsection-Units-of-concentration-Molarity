Molarity, M, is defined as the moles of solute divided by the liters of solution. In this chapter, it is critical to specify the nature of the moles and the volume, as one can think of moles of solute or moles of solvent, as well as liters of solution or liters of solvent.
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ M=\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}}\label{\chapterlabel:equation2}
\end{equation}
For example, if we mix 0.4 moles of NaCl and we fill the beaker until we reach a 100mL (0.1L) mark, the molarity of the solution will be 4M.
