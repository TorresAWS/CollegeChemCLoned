Density of a solution--often expressed in g/mL--is the ration of the grams of solution and the mL of solution.
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \text{d}=\frac{\text{grams of solution}}{\text{mL of solution}} }\label{\chapterlabel:equation6}
\end{equation}
Density is used to convert mass of solution into volume of solution, of the opposite. In the case of pure water, density of water is 1g/mL that is the mass in grams of water equals to its volume in mL.
