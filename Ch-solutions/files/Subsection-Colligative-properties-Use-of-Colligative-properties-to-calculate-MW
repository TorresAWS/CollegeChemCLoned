Colligative properties measurements are also useful in order to calculate molar masses of solutes as most of these properties are related to concentration and concentration is related to the molar mass of the solute. The method is based on carrying any colligative measurement, for example, the boiling point elevation, the freezing point depression, or the osmotic pressure, and with these measurements computing the corresponding concentration, molarity of molarity. Once we have the concentration we can use Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation17} in order to compute the molar mass of the solute. We will work on an example:
