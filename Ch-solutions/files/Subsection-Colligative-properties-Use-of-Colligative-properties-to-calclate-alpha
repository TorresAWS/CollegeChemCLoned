Colligative measurements can be used to calculate the percent dissociation ($\alpha$) of an electrolyte. The idea is to compare the nominal concentration based on the preparation of the electrolyte solution and the effective concentration of ions and molecules in the solution obtained using the colligative measurements. Remember these measurements directly depend on the total number of particles in the solution: ions and molecules.  However, in a weak electrolyte, the nominal concentration used to prepare the solution is not the same as the effective concentration of ions and molecules. This is because the concentration of ions and molecules in solution as weak electrolytes break down based on the degree of dissociation and, at the same time, the number of ions produced depends on the Van't Hoff factor $i$. The following equation gives the effective concentration of solute particles in the solution for a weak electrolyte in terms of the Van't Hoff factor and the nominal concentration:
\[ c^{\text{effective}}=c^{\text{Nominal}}\cdot (1+ (i-1)\frac{\alpha}{100}) \]
For example, imagine we prepare a 0.1M ($c^{\text{Nominal}}$) solution of a weak electrolyte with a 98\% degree of dissociation ($\alpha$) and the electrolyte dissociates into two different ions ($i$=2). The number of solute particles in the solution, that is the effective concentration of particles, will be 0.198M. As you can see this number is larger than 0.1M as it accounts not only for molecules (0.002M) but also for ions (0.196M).
The following example demonstrates how to compute electrolyte's degree of dissociation using osmotic pressure measurements.
