 \subsection*{Part A. Preparing the resin.}
\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Obtain around 5g of the dry, ion exchange resin in a 250 mL beaker. Remember that this resin can be recycled. Do not discard it at the end of the experiment.

	\newstep[] Add enough 6 M HCl to cover the resin. By adding the acid, the resin is cleaned of metallic cations. To use the ion exchange resin, it must be clean, also known as "in \ce{H+} form".

	\newstep[] Now you are going to wash the acid away. After 2 minutes, add 200 mL of distilled water to the resin-acid mixture.  Allow the resin to settle in the bottom of the beaker.
	\newstep[] Carefully, pour the liquid off (decant) into another beaker. This liquid is an HCl solution and should be handled and discarded as such.
	\newstep[] To ensure that all the acid is gone, wash again the resin with 200 mL of distilled water. Allow the resin to settle in the bottom of the beaker and pour the liquid into another beaker.
	\newstep[] Before you discard the liquid you can test the pH. Dip the tip of a glass stirring rod in the liquid and poke the wet end of the rod into a piece of Blue Litmus paper. If the Litmus paper turns pink, there is still acid, repeat steps 5 and 6. If it does not turn pink, the resin is clean and ready to be used. Reserve the resin for Part B.


 \end{steps}\subsection*{Part B. Measure the hardness of a sample of softened water}\begin{steps}

	\newstep[] Obtain a little bit more than 150 mL of hard water in a beaker. Hard water is already prepared in the lab.

	\newstep[] Using a graduated cylinder, add 20.0 mL of hard water to a 125 mL Erlenmeyer. Reserve this water for Part C. Use the rest of the water for this part of the experiment.

  
	\newstep[] Transfer the remaining hard water to the beaker with the resin and let it stand for 25 minutes. In the meantime, proceed with Parts C and D.


	\newstep[] Pour off about 40 mL of the water sample that has been in contact with the resin into a clean beaker. This sample would be referred to as the softened water.

	\newstep[] Using a graduated cylinder, add 20.0 mL of the softened water to a 125 mL Erlenmeyer.
 
	\newstep[] Add 5 mL of an \ce{NH3}/\ce{NH4Cl} buffer solution (not to be confused with \ce{Na2H2(EDTA)}) to the Erlenmeyer and the tip of a spatula (less than a pea-sized amount) of the indicator (a solid mixture of eriochrome black T and sodium chloride). Adding too many indicators will ruin the experiment. The solution color will be rose pink after the addition of the indicator.

	\newstep[] Now, we are going to titrate the water sample. Obtain about 20 mL of 0.01 M \ce{Na2H2(EDTA)} (the full name is Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) in a 50 mL beaker and a medicine dropper (or a plastic Pasteur pipette). Add the \ce{Na2H2(EDTA)} drop by drop to the mixture while stirring. As the endpoint is approached the solution color will become lavender. Count the drops needed for the analyte to turn blue. When the addition of one drop turns the solution blue, all \ce{Ca2+} and \ce{Mg2+} ions have been removed from the sample
 
 
	\newstep[] Clean the resin as described in Part A, and return the resin to the instructor--there is a large beaker ready to collect wet resin.




    

  \end{steps}\subsection*{Part C. Measure the hardness of a water sample}\begin{steps}



	\newstep[] While Part B takes place, and the water becomes softer, add 5 mL of a \ce{NH3}/\ce{NH4Cl} buffer solution (not to be confused with \ce{Na2H2(EDTA)})  to the Erlenmeyer, and the tip of a spatula (less than a pea-sized amount) of the indicator. Rememer that the indicator is just a solid mixture of eriochrome black T and sodium chloride. Adding too many indicators will ruin the experiment. The solution color will be rose pink after the addition of the indicator.

	\newstep[] Now, we are going to titrate the water sample. Obtain about 20 mL of 0.01 M \ce{Na2H2(EDTA)} in a 50 mL beaker and a medicine dropper (or a plastic Pasteur pipette). Add the \ce{Na2H2(EDTA)} drop by drop to the mixture while stirring. As the endpoint is approached the solution color will become lavender. Count the drops needed for the analyte to turn blue. When the addition of one drop turns the solution blue, all \ce{Ca2+} and \ce{Mg2+} ions have been removed from the sample

  \end{steps}\subsection*{Part D. Observing reactions with \ce{Ca^2+} and \ce{Mg^2+} ions}\begin{steps}


 
 
\newstep[] Obtain 4 test tubes and locate the following solutions: 0.10 M \ce{Ca(NO3)2}, 0.10 M \ce{Na2CO3}, 0.10 M\ce{NaHCO3}, and 0.10 M \ce{Mg(NO3)2}.
\newstep[] In test tube 1, add 10 drops of \textbf{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}}. Add 10 drops of \ce{Na2CO3} and write down your observations. 
\newstep[] In test tube 2, add 10 drops of \textbf{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}}. Add 2 drops of HCl and write down your observations.
\newstep[] In test tube 3, add 10 drops of \textbf{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}}. Add 10 drops of 0.1 M \ce{NaHCO3} and write down your observations.


\newstep[] Now, Heat test tube 3 in the flame of a Bunsen burner. Write down your observations.
 
\newstep[] Now, cool down test tube 3. Add 2 drops of 6M HCl and write down your observations.

\newstep[] In test tube 4, add a pea-sized amount of solid \ce{CaCO3}. Add 2 drops of 6M HCl and write down your observations.

 \newstep[] Now, repeat the steps above using \textbf{\ce{Mg(NO3)2}} instead of \textbf{\ce{Ca(NO3)2}}.
 
 \newstep[] At this point, complete the remaining steps of Part B.
