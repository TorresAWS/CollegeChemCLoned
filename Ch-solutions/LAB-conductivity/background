Playing with water near electrical appliances can be risky. Surprisingly, however, water does not conduct electricity. For electricity to propagate through media there must be free charges that move along the electric field. Pure water does not contain a significant number of charges and does not conduct electricity. However, when there is something dissolved in the water, therefore making an aqueous solution, it can be conductive.

\subsection*{Conductivity and aqueous solutions}

Whether the aqueous solution is conductive or not depends on the nature of the solute. If the solute dissociates into ions when dissolved in water, the ions will conduct electricity. These types of chemicals are called electrolytes. If the solute dissolves as a molecule without dissociation, the solution will not conduct electricity and the solute will be called nonelectrolyte.

\subsection*{Conductivity units}

The unit for conductivity is Siemens per centimeter, S$\cdot $cm$^{-1}$. Pay attention to the units during this experiment because the tool will often display prefixes like milliSiemens or microSiemens per centimeter. Temperature affects conductivity and must be recorded during the measurement of this property.

\subsection*{Types of electrolytes and factors affecting their conductivity.}

Salt and sugar are soluble in water. When sugar dissolves in water its molecules remain intact because water can not break apart the strong covalent bonds between their atoms. As a neutral molecule, sugar in solution will not conduct electricity and it is an example of a \textbf{nonelectrolyte}. Salt, sodium chloride or \ce{NaCl}, is an ionic compound that gives place to two ions, \ce{Na+} and \ce{Cl-} when dissolved in water. These ions are responsible for the solution's conductivity. The number or more specifically the concentration, and the mobility of these ions will determine how conductive the solution is.
Based on these principles we can classify substances as:
 \begin{itemize}{}
	\item \textbf{Non-electrolytes}. When the aqueous solution of that substance does not conduct electricity. In general terms, these electrolytes present low conductivities, lower than 10$\mu$S$\cdot $cm$^{-1}$.
	\item \textbf{Weak electrolyte}. When the aqueous solution of that substance conducts electricity poorly. In general terms, these electrolytes present medium conductivities,  between 10-1000$\mu$S$\cdot $cm$^{-1}$.
	\item \textbf{Strong electrolyte}. When the conductivity of the aqueous solution of that substance is high. In general terms, these electrolytes present large conductivities, larger than 1000$\mu$S$\cdot $cm$^{-1}$.

 \end{itemize}
The \textbf{mobility} of the ions is related to their size. Small ions move fast which enhances conductivity, while large ions encounter more resistance to move and show lower conductivities. 
The table below displays a series of mobility values for positive and negative ions at infinite dilution and 298K and 1 atm.

\end{tabular}\end{center} 


The effect of ions$'$ mobility is easily appreciated in isomolar solutions, which are solutions with the same molarity. The more ions in the solution, the higher the conductivity will be. For the same substance, the number of ions is determined by the \textbf{concentration}; more concentration means more ions and more conductivity. It is important to recall that only ions contribute to conductivity. While some molecules dissociate completely, others dissociate only partially. The latter are weak electrolytes. Interestingly, when two solutions containing ions are mixed, the conductivity of the resulting solution will be equal to the sum of the two separate solutions with the same concentration as in the mixture. This is called the \textbf{additivity rule} and will hold as long as the ions do not react with each other. When two electrolytes undergo a chemical reaction, new products will form and the additivity rule will not apply. A large deviation from the sum of separate conductivities is an indication of a chemical reaction.
