We measured the volume of the same sample several times obtaining the following values: 10.12 mL, 10.12 mL, 10.13mL, 10.14 mL, and 10.15 mL. Answer the following questions:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item Compute the average, $\bar x$.
\item Compute the standard deviation of the measurement, $\sigma$.
\item Report the measured volume in the form $\bar x \pm \sigma$.
\item Given that he true volume is 10.50mL, describe the accuracy and precision of the measurement
\end{inparaenum}

 Answer:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item 10.13mL
\item 0.01mL
\item Report the measured volume in the form $10.13  \pm 0.01$mL.
\item precise and inaccurate
\end{inparaenum}
