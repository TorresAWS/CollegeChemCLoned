\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Density is mass over volume. The mass of the object is 30g and its volume is (90-60)mL that is 30mL. Hence: $d=30g/30mL=1g/mL$.

A lead weight used in the belt of a scuba diver has a mass of 226 g. When the weight is placed in a graduated cylinder containing 200.0 mL of water, the water level rises to 220.0 mL. What is the density of the lead weight (g/mL)?
\flushright Answer:$11.3\text{ }g/mL$.
