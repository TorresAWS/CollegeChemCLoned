\begin{example} % EXAMPLE BOX
After adding a 30g object into a cylinder filled of water, the level of water rises from 60mL to 90mL. Calculate the density of the object. \\

\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Density is mass over volume. The mass of the object is 30g and its volume is (90-60)mL that is 30mL. Hence: $d=30g/30mL=1g/mL$.
