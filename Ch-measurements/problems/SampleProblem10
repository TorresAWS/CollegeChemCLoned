Classify as  element, compound, homogeneous mixture, heterogeneous mixture:
\begin{multicols}{4}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item An iron nail
\item Milk
\item Sugar
\item miso soup 
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) An iron nail is an element as it is only made of iron, a single material; (b) Milk is a homogeneous mixture as it is made of water, fat, protein even though you only see a single substance; (c) Sugar is a compound made of carbon and other constituents; (d) miso soup is a mixture of water, fat and other chemicals and therefore is a mixture. As you can differentiate its constituents we call this heterogeneous mixture.\\
