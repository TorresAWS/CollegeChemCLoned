\emph{Solid} has a well-defined shape and volume. Think about an ice cube, for example, that is made of water in the form of ice. In an ice cube, attractive forces keep the shape of the cube constant. The water molecules in the ice are arranged in rigid patterns and they can only vibrate in the solid. A \emph{liquid}, on the other hand, has a well-defined volume. However, liquids do not have a constant shape, as their shape will depend on the shape of the container. Think about water that is a liquid. You can find many different bottle shapes. In all of them, the molecules of water will arrange to occupy the shape of the container. The volume of the liquid--the amount of space the liquid occupies--will be constant but not the shape. In a liquid, the particles move randomly but are still attached. A \emph{gas} does not have a well-defined shape or volume. In a gas, the particles are randomly distributed and barely interact with each other, as they move at high speeds, taking the shape and volume of their container. 
The process of boiling and freezing represent \emph{physical changes} and during physical changes, these substances involved do not change their composition. When water boils, both steam and water are made of the same component, \ce{H2O}. When a substance undergoes a \emph{chemical process}, it will change its composition. For example, when burning a piece of paper, paper made of carbon, hydrogen, and hydrogen becomes ash made mostly of carbon. As such, during a chemical process, a substance (e.g. paper) becomes a new substance (e.g. carbon).
