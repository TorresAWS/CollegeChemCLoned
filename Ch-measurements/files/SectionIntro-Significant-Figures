\section{Significant Figures}
Exact numbers results from counting. For example, think about how many eggs are there in your refrigerator, there might be three and this number is an exact number.
Differently, numbers that results from a measurement are called measured values and they are subject to uncertainty--in another words error.  For example, if you weight a single egg in an scale depending of the type of scale you used you will measure 70g or 71g or maybe 70.8g. The mass of an egg is a measured property and hence some of the digits of the measurement are uncertain. The goal of this section is, given a value, calculate the number of significant figures of a number (we will refer to significant figures as SF, or SFs). Another goal is to estimate significant figures in calculation in order to express the result with the right number of digits and significant figures.
