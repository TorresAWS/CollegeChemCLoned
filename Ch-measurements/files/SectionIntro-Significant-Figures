Exact numbers result from counting. For example, think about how many eggs are there in your refrigerator, there might be three and this number is exact.
Differently, numbers that result from a measurement are called measured values and they are subject to uncertainty--in other words error.  For example, if you weigh a single egg on a scale depending on the type of scale you used and the person who carries out the measurement, you will measure 70g or 71g, or maybe 70.8g. The mass of an egg is a measured property and hence some of the digits of the measurement are uncertain. The goal of this section is, given a value, to calculate the number of significant figures of a number (we will refer to significant figures as SF, or SFs). Another goal is to estimate significant figures in the calculation to express the result with the right number of digits and significant figures.
