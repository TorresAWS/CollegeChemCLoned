Mixtures can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a \emph{homogeneous mixture}--also known as solutions--the composition is uniform throughout the sample. An example of an homogeneous mixture is air, which contains oxygen and nitrogen or salty water, a solution of salt and water. \emph{Heterogeneous mixtures} are mixtures in which the components are not uniformly distributed throughout the sample. An example would be a chocolate chip cookie in which you can differentiate the dough and the chocolate.
