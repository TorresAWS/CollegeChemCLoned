What is your weight? The mass of an object is a measure of the quantity of material it contains. You may be more familiar with the term weight rather than mass. However, mass and weight are not the same, as weight is a measure of the gravitational pull on an object. It differs depending on your location on the earth--in particular the height of your location. In the metric system, the unit of mass is the gram (g). The SI unit of mass, the kilogram (kg), is used for larger masses such as body weight. A pound, lb, is another unit of mass. The most important units of mass are g, kg, and lb.
