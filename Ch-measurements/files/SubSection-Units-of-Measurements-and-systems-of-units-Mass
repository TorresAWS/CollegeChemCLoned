What is you weight? The mass of an object is a measure of the quantity of material it contains. You may be more familiar with the term weight than with mass. However, mass and weight are not exactly the same, as  weight is a measure of the gravitational pull on an object. It differs depending on your location in the earth--in particular the height of your location. In the metric system, the unit for mass is the gram (g). The SI unit of mass, the kilogram (kg), is used for larger masses such as body weight. Pound, lb, is another unit of mass. The most important units of mass are: g, kg and lb.
