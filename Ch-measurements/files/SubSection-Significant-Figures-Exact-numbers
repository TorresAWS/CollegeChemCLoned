Exact numbers are numbers obtained by counting and not by measuring or obtained by a relationship that compared two units in the same measuring system. For example, the number of students in a class is exact as we need to count to get this number. Similarly, the number of grams in a kilogram, a thousand, is exact as the relationship between kilogram and gram is exact. Exact numbers do not have significant figures and do not limit the number of figures in a calculation.
