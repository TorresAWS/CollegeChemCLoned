Density depends on volume and in particular the larger volume the smaller density. Figure \ref{Fig:VolumeAndObjects} displays the formulas to calculate the volume for some common objects, like a sphere or a cube. For example, the radius of a sphere with density $d$ and mass $m$ corresponds to $\sqrt[3]{3m/4d\cdot \pi}$, and the side of a cube with density $d$ and mass $m$ corresponds to $\sqrt[3]{m/d}$.
