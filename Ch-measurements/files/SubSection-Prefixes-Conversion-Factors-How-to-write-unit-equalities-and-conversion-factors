Unit equalities are simple expressions that relate a unit with a unit with prefix. For example: one centimeter (cm) is $1\times10^{-2}$m. Hence we can write this as a unit equality:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   1cm=1\times10^{-2}m}\text{ unit equality}    
\end{equation*}
Let\textquotesingle s compare cm and m. The first, cm, is a unit with a prefix, whereas m is simple a unit of length without a prefix. In order know how many m are there in a cm we need to write down a conversion factor. Think about prefixes as synonymous of a number. In this way, centi stands for  $1\times10^{-2}$, so

\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   \frac{1cm}{1\times10^{-2}m}\ \enspace \text{ or  } \enspace \frac{1\times10^{-2}m}{1cm} }  \  \text{ conversion factor}   
\end{equation*}
The relationship above is also called a \emph{unit factor} as both ratios equal to one.
