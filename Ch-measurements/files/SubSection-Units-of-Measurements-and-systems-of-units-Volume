\item[\docfilehook{Volume}{}] How much milk do you usually buy? Maybe a gallon. Volume is the amount of space that a substance occupies. A liter (L) is commonly used to measure volume. The milliliter (mL) is more convenient for measuring smaller volumes of fluids in hospitals and laboratories. Gallon is still used in every-day life.  L, mL and gallon are units of volume. Units of volume are in general cubic units, so for example one liter is the same as one $dm^3$. We will cover cubit units further in this chapter.
