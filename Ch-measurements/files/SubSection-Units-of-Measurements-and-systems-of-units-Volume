How much milk do you usually buy? Maybe a gallon. Volume is the amount of space that a substance occupies. A liter (L), not a fundamental but a derived SI unit, is commonly used to measure volume. The milliliter (mL) is more convenient for measuring smaller volumes of fluids in hospitals and laboratories. Gallon is still used in everyday life.  L, mL, and gallon are units of volume. Units of volume are in general cubic units, so for example one liter is the same as one $dm^3$. We will cover cubit units further in this chapter. 

Chemical laboratory work commonly requires the measurement of volume. 
There are two main types of glassware used to measure volume in a chemistry lab: graduated tools and volumetric tools. 
Volumetric pipets, flasks, and burets are the most accurate; the glassware makers calibrate these to a high level of accuracy, usually measured in terms of tolerance, which is the uncertainty in a measurement made with the glassware. Class A volumetric glassware has a lower tolerance than Class B; for class A, the tolerance can be as low as 0.08 ml for a 100 ml flask or pipet. Generally, measurements with class A volumetric glassware can be considered reliable to two places after the decimal point. Graduated cylinders, beakers, and Erlenmeyer flasks have less accuracy than volumetric glassware. Graduated cylinders can generally be considered reliable to within 1 percent. Beakers and Erlenmeyer flasks should not be used to measure volume unless you need only a very crude estimate because their accuracy for volume measurements is so poor. They can hold a much larger volume than any of the other types of glassware, however, which makes them useful for mixing solutions.
