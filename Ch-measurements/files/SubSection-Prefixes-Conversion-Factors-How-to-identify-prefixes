Look for example at the measurement 2 cm. Centi (c) is the prefix and means $1\times10^{-2}$ and meter (m) is the unit which refers to length. Another example, 7 kg means kilogram. Kilo (k) is the prefix and means $1\times10^{3}$, whereas gram (g) is the unit that refers to mass. The prefix refers to the first letter whereas the unit refers to the last letter. \\
Would you prefer to be paid a kilodollar, a dollar or a centidollar? A unit with a prefix can be bigger or smaller than the plain unit--this is the unit without prefix--, depending on the prefix. The following prefixes make the unit smaller: deci, centi, milli, micro, nano, pico and femto. For example a fs (femtosecond) is smaller than a s (second). Differently, the following prefixes make the unit larger: Tera, Giga, Mega. For example a Tb (terabyte) is larger than a b (byte). byte is a unit used in computer science.
