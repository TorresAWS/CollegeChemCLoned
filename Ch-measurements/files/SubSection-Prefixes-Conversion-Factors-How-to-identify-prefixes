Look for example at the measurement 2 cm. Centi (c) is the prefix and means $1\times10^{-2}$ and meter (m) is the unit that refers to length. Another example, is 7 kg read as seven kilograms. Kilo (k) is the prefix and means $1\times10^{3}$, whereas gram (g) is the unit that refers to mass. The prefix refers to the first letter whereas the unit refers to the last letter. \\
A unit with a prefix can be bigger or smaller than the plain unit--this is the unit without a prefix--, depending on the prefix. The following prefixes reduce the unit: deci, centi, milli, micro, nano, pico, and femto. For example, a fs (femtosecond) is smaller than a s (second). Differently, the following prefixes increase the unit: Tera, Giga, Mega. For example, a Tb (terabyte) is larger than a b (byte). A byte is a unit used in computer science.
