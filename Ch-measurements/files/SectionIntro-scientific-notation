Numbers in science can often be very large or very tinny. For example, the mass of the earth is 590000000000000000000000000 grams, whereas the size of an atom is of the order 0.00000000001cm. Scientific notation is a standard notation extensively used among the scientific community to simplify numbers. Numbers not expressed in scientific notation are referred to as numbers in full notation (e.g. $0.234$g). Numbers expressed in scientific notation place the decimal after the first significant digit while being accompanied by a power of ten (e.g. $2.34\times 10^{-1}$g). 
In order to express a number (e.g. $345000$g) in scientific notation, we just need to leave the first digit followed by the decimal point which was moves in this case to the left 5 places, giving $3.45\times 10^{5}$g. The power of ten can contain a positive or a negative exponent. Positive exponents represent large numbers, whereas negative exponents represent numbers smaller than 1. Below are two examples of full and scientific notation. On one hand a number smaller than one:
\begin{equation*}
    0.000134\text{g}\ \enspace \text{ (full notation) } \quad \enspace  1.34\times 10^{-4}\text{g}    \  \text{ (scientific notation)}   
\end{equation*}
On the other hand, a number larger than one:
\begin{equation*}
    4500000\text{g}\ \enspace \text{ (full notation) } \quad\enspace  4.5\times 10^{6}\text{g}    \  \text{ (scientific notation)}   
\end{equation*}
