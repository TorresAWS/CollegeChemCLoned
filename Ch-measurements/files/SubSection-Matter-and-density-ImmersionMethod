The density of liquids results from measuring the mass of a given volume of the liquid. Differently, density is harder to obtain for solids. For metals, we can calculate density by the immersion method: when a metal is immersed in water, the water rises. This increase in volume corresponds to the volume of the solid. This way, density results from the direct measurement of mass and the measurement of volume by displacement.
