Let\textquotesingle s consider the following measurements: 1 \begin{bf}k\end{bf}m, 2 \begin{bf}c\end{bf}m, and 3 m that can be read as one kilometer, two centimeters, and three meters. The word kilo (\begin{bf}k\end{bf}) and centi (\begin{bf}c\end{bf}) are called prefixed whereas meter (m) is a simple unit. Kilometer is larger than meter, whereas centimeter is smaller than a meter. Prefixes such as kilo or centi are attached to units in order to make numbers more manageable. For example, the radius of the earth is 6356 km, and this number is easier to handle than 6356000m. At the same time, we can attach any prefix to different units. Hence, we can talk about a centimeter (\begin{bf}c\end{bf}m) but also about a centisecond (\begin{bf}c\end{bf}s) or centiliter (\begin{bf}c\end{bf}L). All these units have the same prefix. Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter} lists some of the metric prefixes, their symbols, and their decimal values.
