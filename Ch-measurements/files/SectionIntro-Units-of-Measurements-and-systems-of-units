\section{Units of Measurements and systems of units}
You probably heard the term liter, kilogram or meter. These are units of measurement. Units can be classified into different \emph{systems of units}. For example, the unit \emph{meter} belongs to a different system than the unit \emph{mile}. In particular here we will address two main systems: the English System used in the US and the Metric System used by most of the industrialized world.
The \emph{Metric System} (MS) is used by  scientists throughout the world and is the most common measuring system based on the meter. The \emph{International System of Units} (SI) adopted the metric system in 1960 in order to provide additional uniformity for units used the sciences. This chapter will be mostly based on the SI units. In the following we will introduce some common units.
