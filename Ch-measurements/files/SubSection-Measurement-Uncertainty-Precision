The terms precision and accuracy are two different terms often used to describe the reliability of measurement. Accuracy refers to the degree of agreement between the measured value and the true value, the real value of the property measured. Measurements that closely agree with the true value are accurate. Precision refers to the agreement between several measurements. Two measurements are accurate when they are close, independently of the true value of the property measured. Two different types of errors occur during a measurement. On one hand, random error refers to the fact that measured values can be above or below the true value. On the other hand, systematic error is an error that occurs each time in the same direction. Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Targets-and-precision} displays accurate and inaccurate measurements as well as precise and imprecise measurements.
