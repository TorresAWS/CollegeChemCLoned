Most chemistry experiments require the measurement of a property (mass, volume, temperature, color...), and the validity of those experiments will depend on the reliability of each measurement. The reliability of a measurement is usually considered in terms of its \textit{accuracy} and its \textit{precision}. At the same time, when performing an experiment often times, one needs to repeate measurements. The results need to take into account the average measurement as well as the standard derivation of the series of results.
