A graph represents data in terms of a relationship between two variables. These quantities are plotted along two axes the Y or vertical axis and the X or horizontal axis. The title of the graph indicates what is being represented, and for example, on the graph above we have represented the change of solubility of a chemical with temperature. The vertical axis represents solubility given a range between 0 and 120 g/100g of water. The horizontal axis represents temperature with a range between 0 and 100$^{\circ}$C. Each point in the graph represents the value of solubility for a given temperature. Based on the graph we can see that solubility slowly increases as temperature increases. We could estimate the value of solubility for any temperature within the range given and for example at a temperature of 50 $^{\circ}$C the solubility should be close to 50 g/100g of water.
