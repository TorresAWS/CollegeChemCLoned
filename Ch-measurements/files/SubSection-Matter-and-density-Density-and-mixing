A small piece of ice will float on water. The reason for that is density: density of ice (0.9g/mL) is smaller than density of water (1.0g/mL) and hence ice will stay on top of water. Objects with density larger than 1 g/mL will sink whereas objects with density smaller than this value will float. If you add a drop of vegetable oil to a glass of water, the drop will float. This is because the density of oil is smaller than 1g/mL.
