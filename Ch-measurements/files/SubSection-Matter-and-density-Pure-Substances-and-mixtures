On one hand, \emph{pure substances} have definite composition, being only made of a single component. For example, water and gold are pure substances. However, there are two different types of pure substances: elements and compounds. \emph{Elements} are composed of only one type of atom. Examples are silver, iron, and aluminum. They all contain one type of substance, and for example, iron is only made of iron atoms. \emph{Compounds} are combinations of different elements. For example, water, \ce{H2O} is a compound made of a combination of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. On the other hand, \emph{mixtures} are physical combinations of different pure substances. Mixtures have variable composition. For example, air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. Wood, soda pop, or soil are all mixtures. Mixtures can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a \emph{homogeneous mixture}--also known as solutions--the composition is uniform throughout the sample. An example of a homogeneous mixture is salty water, a solution of salt and water. \emph{Heterogeneous mixtures} are mixtures in which the components are not uniformly distributed throughout the sample. An example would be a chocolate chip cookie in which you can differentiate the dough and the chocolate.
