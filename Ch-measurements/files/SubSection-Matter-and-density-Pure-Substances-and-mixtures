\item[\docfilehook{Pure Substances and mixtures}{}] \emph{Pure substances} have a definite composition, that is, are only made of one thing. There are two different types of pure substances: elements and compounds. \emph{Elements} are composed of only one type of atom. Examples are silver, iron, and aluminum that all contain one type of substance, and iron is only made of iron atoms, for example. \emph{Compounds} are combinations of different elements. For example, water, \ce{H2O} is made of a combination of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. \emph{Mixtures} are physical combinations of different substances. For example, air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen.
