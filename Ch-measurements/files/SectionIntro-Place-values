We can identify the place value in any number for all its digits. The place values are named based on the location concerning the decimal place. For digits to the left of the decimal place, the place values are called the ones, the tens, the hundreds, and the thousands. For example, in the value 3456s, the number 3 is the thousands place, the number 4 is the hundreds place, 5 is the tens place and 6 is the one's place. For digits to the right of the decimal place, the place values are called the tenths, the hundredths, and the thousandths, mind the suffix \emph{ths}. For example, in the value 3.456Kg, the number 3 is the one place, the number 4 is the tenth place, 5 is the hundredth place and 6 is the thousandth place.
