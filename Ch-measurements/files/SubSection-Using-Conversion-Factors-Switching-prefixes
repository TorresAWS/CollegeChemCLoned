To switch a prefix into another prefix, such as transforming 30 millimeters (30 mm) into centimeters (cm), you will need two different conversion factors: the first conversion factor will remove the original unit (mm) introducing an intermediate unit, meters (m), whereas the second conversion factor will remove the intermediate meter and introduce the final unit (cm). You will get the conversion factors from Table \ref{tab:Table-Prefixes}. You will arrange the first conversion factor so that the original unit cancels out with the bottom of the first conversion factor, giving you an intermediate unit. You will arrange the second conversion factor so that the intermediate unit cancels out with the bottom of the second conversion factor giving the final unit. For this example:
 \begin{equation*}
30\cancel{mm} \times \dfrac{1\times10^{-3}\cancel{m}}{1\cancel{mm}}   \times \dfrac{1cm}{1\times10^{-2}\cancel{m}}       =3cm
\end{equation*}
