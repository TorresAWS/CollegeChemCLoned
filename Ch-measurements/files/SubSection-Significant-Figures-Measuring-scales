\emph{Measured numbers} result from measuring a property such as the weight or length of an object. Those measurements result from using a measuring device such as a scale or a ruler, for example. Imagine we want to measure the length of both objects presented in Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-rulers}. The metric rules presented have a set of marked divisions which determine the number of figures given by the measurement. For example, the ruler on the left has 1cm and 0.1cm divisions, whereas the rule on the right only has 1cm divisions, hence giving fewer figures. 

Let us estimate the length of the object on the right. The end of the object on the right is located between 0cm and 1cm, therefore its length is less than 1cm. Still, we can estimate an extra digit by dividing the space between the lines. Still, this last \emph{estimated digit} might differ from person to person. The final measurement would be 0.8cm. However, some people would read the length as 0.7cm whereas others 0.9cm. 
Let us now estimate the length of the object on the left. The end of the object on the right is located between 3.1cm and 3.2cm, therefore its length is less than 3.2cm. We can estimate an extra digit as well, giving a final measurement of 3.15cm.
