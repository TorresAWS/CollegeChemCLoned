How many hours are 300 minutes, or how many centimeters is 2 inches? Some of the units conversion is not based on a power of ten relationships and do not contain prefixes such as kilo or centi. Table \ref{Table-Common-units} lists some of the common equalities that can be easily converted into conversion factors. As an example, the unit equivalency between hours and minutes is $60min=1h$ and the conversion factor would be $\dfrac{60min}{1h}$ or $\dfrac{1h}{60min}$.
