\item[\docfilehook{Using other equalities}{}] How many hours is 300 minutes, or how many centimeters is 2 inches? Some of the units conversion are not based on a power of ten relationship such as the ones in Table \ref{tab:units2}. Table \ref{tab:units3} lists some of the common equalities that can be easily converted into conversion factor. As an example, the unit equivalency between hours and minutes is $60min=1h$ and the conversion factor would be $\dfrac{60min}{1h}$ or $\dfrac{1h}{60min}$.
