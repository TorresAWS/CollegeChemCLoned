How many hours is 300 minutes, or how many centimeters is 2 inches? Some of the units conversion are not based on a power of ten relationship and do not contain prefixes such as kilo or centi. Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter} lists some of the common equalities that can be easily converted into conversion factor. As an example, the unit equivalency between hours and minutes is $60min=1h$ and the conversion factor would be $\dfrac{60min}{1h}$ or $\dfrac{1h}{60min}$.
