We have positive and negative numbers. Positive numbers are larger than zero whereas negative numbers are smaller than zero. Negative numbers are written with a negative ($-$) sign. The multiplication or division of two positive or two negative numbers always gives a positive result, whereas the multiplication or division of a positive and a negative number always gives a negative result.
When we add two positive numbers the results are always positive, whereas when we add two negative numbers the results are always negative. When positive and negative numbers are added, the results come from substracting the smallest number from the largest number while keeping the sign of the larger number. In a calculator, there is a key \keystroke{($-$)} (sometimes shown as \keystroke{($+/-$)}) used to switch the sign of a number.
