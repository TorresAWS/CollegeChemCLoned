Reading a liquid meniscus is similar to reading any measuring scale. There are two types of menisci. A concave meniscus, which is what you normally will see, occurs when the molecules of the liquid are attracted to those of the container. This occurs with water and a glass tube. A convex meniscus occurs when the molecules have a stronger attraction to each other than to the container, as with mercury and glass. If the meniscus is concave, read at the lowest level of the curve. If the meniscus is convex, take your measurement at the highest point of the curve. Let us read the menisci from the image below. Readings are 16.0mL (left), 8.5mL (center left), 18.0mL (center right), and 18.5mL (right).
