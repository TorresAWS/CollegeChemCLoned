The specific gravity ($\rho$) of a substance is the ratio between its density and the density of a reference, normally water. It is simply calculated by dividing the density of the substance and the density of water (1g/mL at room temperature). 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{   \rho=\frac{\text{density of substance}}{\text{density of water}}   }
\label{formulaspecificgravity}
\end{equation}
A substance with a specific gravity of 1 has a density of 1g/mL. This is a unitless property that can be measured with an instrument called a hydrometer. For example, the specific density of the urine in the body is used to identify diabetes or kidney malfunctioning.
