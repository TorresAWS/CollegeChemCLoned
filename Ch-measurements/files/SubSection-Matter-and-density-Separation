Chemists and scientists often need to separate the components of a mixture. There are many analytical techniques used to separate and identify the components of a mixture. These techniques exploit the differences in the chemical or physical properties of the components of the mixture to separate the different elements. The techniques used to separate mixtures are called \emph{separation techniques}. Distillation is an important separation technique used to separate compounds with 
different volatility--different tendencies to generate vapor. For example, a mixture containing water and gasoline can be distilled as the components of the mixture largely differ in their volatility. The distillation setup consists of a distilling flask containing the mixture to be distilled, a condenser, and a receiving flask. When the mixture is heated the most volatile component will separate first and with the help of the condenser--a cooled tube--will cool down into liquid and deposit on the receiving flask. It is important to understand that only mixtures of liquids of mixtures of solids and liquids can be distilled.
Another important separation technique is \emph{filtration}. This technique is used to separate mixtures of solids and liquids. The mixture to be filtered is poured into a mesh--for example a filter--that retains the solid and lets the liquid pass.
\emph{Chromatography} is another separation technique. Indeed, the name represents a series of methods that uses two different phases, a mobile phase, and a stationary phase, to separate the components of a mixture. 
The principle behind this technique is the differences in affinity of the mixture components towards the mobile and stationary phases. The stationary phase is a solid whereas the mobile phase can either be a liquid (paper chromatography) or a gas (gas chromatography). Mixture components with a high affinity for the mobile phase will move faster through the chromatographic system.
\emph{Thin layer chromatography} (TLC) relies on capillarity, which is the tendency of liquid substances to rise on the surface of a material. In this technique, a drop of a liquid solution containing different substances (the sample) is deposited on a rectangular piece of filter paper, close to the bottom edge. This paper is called the stationary phase. The bottom end of the paper is immersed in a liquid called the mobile phase, to a point that is just below the spot where the sample was placed. Due to capillarity, the mobile phase will move up along the stationary phase. When the mobile phase reaches the sample, the different components of the mixture will begin to migrate, carried away by the mobile phase. The chemical compounds forming the sample will move with the mobile phase, but as different chemicals have different tendencies to stick to the mobile phase, they will cover different distances in the stationary phase. The different heights achieved by the different substances would allow you to identify those chemicals. A component of the mixture with a high affinity to the mobile phase will migrate more than a component with a higher affinity to the stationary phase.
The distance traveled by a component referred to as the distance traveled by the mobile phase is a measure of the affinity between the chemical and the mobile phase. The \emph{retention factor} $R_f$ of a given chemical is defined as:
\[ R_f=\frac{\text{distance traveled by the chemical}}{\text{total distance traveled by mobile phase}}\]
The $R_f$ value of a substance is characteristic of that substance. When dealing with mixtures one has to calculate the $R_f$ for each pure component separately to then compare the retention factors with the ones obtained in the mixture.
