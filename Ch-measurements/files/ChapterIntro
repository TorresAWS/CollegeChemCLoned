\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}M}{easuring} is an important part of our everyday lives, and very probably you took several measurements today. You might now be sipping a cup of coffee, or perhaps you checked the outside temperature on a street thermometer. You might be planning to bake a cake and need to use a scale and a cup to measure the flour and sugar. A cup, a thermometer, or a scale are measuring devices. This chapter will cover how to accurately measure properties and, more importantly, how to transform measurements using prefixes and unit conversions. In this chapter, by learning how to measure and perform operations with units, you will gain experience performing basic chemistry calculations.
