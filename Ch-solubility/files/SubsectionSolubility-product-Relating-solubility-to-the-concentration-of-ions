We have that insoluble compounds dissolve to produce small amounts of ions in solutions. The concentration of these ions is directly related to solubility $s$ by means of the stoichiometry of the compound. For example, for silver chloride--a salt with a 1:1 stoichiometry--we have that solubility is has a 1 and 1 relationship with the concentration of ions:
\[\big[ \ce{Ag^{+}} \big]=s\text{ and }\big[ \ce{Cl^{-}} \big]=s  \]
Similarly, for barium sulfate we have that solubility has a 1:1 relationship with the concentration of ions:
\[\big[ \ce{Ba^{+2}} \big]=s\text{ and }\big[ \ce{SO4^{-2}} \big]=s  \]
When the stoichiometry of the compound is not 1:1 we need to include the stoichiometry coefficients in the relationship between solubility and ion concentration. For example, for \ce{Ag2SO4}--a compound with 2:1 stoichiometry, we have that
\[\big[ \ce{Ag^{+}} \big]=2\cdot s\text{ and }\big[ \ce{SO4^{-2}} \big]=s  \]
This is because for every mole of silver sulfate we produce two moles of silver--and hence the factor two--and one mole of sulfate in solution. Similarly, for \ce{Nd2(CO3)3} we have
\[\big[ \ce{Nd^{+3}} \big]=2\cdot s\text{ and }\big[ \ce{CO3^{-2}} \big]=3\cdot s  \]
