Some insoluble compounds have acid-base properties. For example, \ce{Mg(OH)2} is an insoluble compound with basic character. This means that its solubility will be related to the OH of the solution. In acidic solutions, its solubility will increase, whereas in basic solutions its solubility will be reduced. For these types of chemicals, it is important to establish a relationship between PH and solubility.
