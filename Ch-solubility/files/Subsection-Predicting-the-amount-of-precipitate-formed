A precipitate can form when mixing two solutions containing specific ions. For example, \ce{AgCl} is an insoluble compound. A precipitate will form if you mix solutions of \ce{AgNO3} and \ce{NaCl}. In these chemicals, \ce{Ag^+} and \ce{Cl^-} are directly involved in the precipitate formation, whereas \ce{NO3^-} and \ce{Na^+} are spectators. In this section, we will cover how to compute the amount of precipitate formed and the concentration of the leftover ions that will contribute to reduce the solubility of the solid, in comparison to plan water. We will leave aside the spectator ions knowing that they will remain in solution and we will focus mainly on the ions involved in the precipitate.
Let us consider the situation in which we mix 5mL of 0.01M-\ce{AgNO3} with 6mL of 0.005M-\ce{AgNO3}. In order to determine the amount of precipitate formed, we will first set up the precipitation reaction:
\begin{center} \ce{Ag^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)} -> AgCl_{(s)}} \end{center}
Then, we will identify the limiting reactant by comparing the moles of ions reacting. We will calculate the moles of \ce{Ag^+} by computing the moles of silver(I) coming from \ce{AgNO3}--when multiplying volume by molarity we obtain milimoles:
\[n^{\ce{Ag^+}}= 5\text{mL}\cdot 0.01\text{M} =5\times 10^{-2}\text{mmol}	\]
We will now calculate the number of moles of chloride:
\[n^{\ce{Cl^-}}= 6\text{mL}\cdot 0.005\text{M} =3\times 10^{-2}\text{mmol}	\]
We have that in order to react with the amount of \ce{Ag^+} in the mixture, we would need $n^{\ce{Cl^-}}=5\times 10^{-2}\text{mmol}$ and we only have $3\times 10^{-2}\text{mmol}$ of chloride, hence chloride is the limiting reagent and the leftovers will be:
\[n^{\ce{Ag^+}}_{left}= 5\times 10^{-2} - 3\times 10^{-2} = 2\times 10^{-2} \text{mmol}	\]
The number of moles of precipitate formed will be given by:
\[n^{\ce{AgCl}}= 3\times 10^{-2}\text{mmol of \ce{Cl^{-}}}\times\frac{1\text{mol of \ce{AgCl}}}{1\text{mol of \ce{Cl^-}}}=3\times 10^{-2}\text{mmol of \ce{AgCl}}	\]
When \ce{AgCl} forms at the same time there will be silver(I) ion leftovers. We will finally calculate the concentration of the leftover ion simply by dividing the leftover moles by the overall volume of the mixture--mind we mix two different volumes assuming liquid volumes can be added:
\[c_{\ce{Ag^+}, left}=\frac{n^{\ce{Ag^+}}_{left}}{V}=\frac{2\times 10^{-2}\text{mmol}}{(5+6)\text{mL}}=1.8\times 10^{-3}\text{M} \]
The ions Silver(I) is a common ion that will affect the solubility of silver chloride, in fact reducing its value:

\begin{center}$K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Ag^+} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{Cl^-} \big]=(s+c_{\ce{Ag^+}, left})\cdot (s)=1.8\times 10^{-10}$\end{center}
that leads to a polynomial
\begin{center}$s^2 + c_{\ce{Ag^+}, left}\cdot s -1.8\times 10^{-10}=0$\end{center}
Solving for $s$ given that $c_{\ce{Ag^+}, left}=1.8\times 10^{-3}\text{M}$ we have that $s=1.0\times 10^{-7}$M, lower than the solubility of silver chloride in water ($1.3\times 10^{-5}$M).
