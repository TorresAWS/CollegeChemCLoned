The values of the solubility product constant can be used to predict the precipitation of a salt when mixing two reganets. Imagine for example that we have a 0.1M \ce{Cu^+} solution and you gradually add a solution containing \ce{I^-}. Given that \ce{CuI} is an insoluble compound with a $K_{sp}$ of $1.27\times 10^{-12}$, the goal would be to compute the \ce{I^-} concentration that would make \ce{CuI} precipitate. We will answer this question by obtaining first the expression for $K_{sp}$:
\begin{center}\ce{CuI_{(s)}  <=> Cu^{+}_{(aq)} + I^{-}_{(aq)}}\hfill $K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Cu^{+}} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{I^{-}} \big]=1.27\times 10^{-12}$\end{center}
As we know the concentration of \ce{Cu^+}, and we have that the concentration of both ions is related by means of the solubility products constant, hence we can solve for the critical $\big[ \ce{I^{-}} \big]_c$ that would make  \ce{CuI} precipitate:
\begin{center}$K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Cu^{+}} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{I^{-}} \big]_c=(0.1)\cdot\big[ \ce{I^{-}} \big]_c=1.27\times 10^{-12}$\end{center}
We have that $\big[ \ce{I^{-}} \big]_c=1.27\times 10^{-11}$M. Hence, Copper(I) iodide will precipitate with a very small iodide concentration.
