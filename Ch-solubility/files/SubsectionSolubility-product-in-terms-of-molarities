Silver chloride, \ce{AgCl} is normally considered an insoluble compound in water. That means this compound will not fully dissolve in water. However, small quantities of the salt will certainly dissolve leading to a small amount of silver and chlorine ions. The dissociation equilibrium involved, indicate below, is characterized by an equilibrium constant $K_{sp}$ called \emph{solubility product constant} or simple \emph{solubility product}:
\begin{center}\ce{AgCl_{(s)}  <=> Ag^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)}}\hfill $K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Ag^+} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{Cl^-} \big]$\end{center}
As pure solids are not part of any equilibrium constant, the formula above does not include silver chloride. As such, all solubility products simply result from the product of the molarities of the ions involved in the dissociation, as hence its name \emph{product}. $K_{sp}$ will have a different explicit expression depending on the formula of the insoluble compound. For example, $K_{sp}$ for calcium fluoride would be:
\begin{center}\ce{CaF2_{(s)}  <=> Ca^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2F^-_{(aq)}}\hfill $K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Ca^{2+}} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{F^-} \big]^2$\end{center}
The solubility product is related to the solubility of the chemical. However, the relation is not one-on-one. For example, $K_{sp}$ for \ce{PbBr2} is$6.6\times 10^{-3}$M, and $K_{sp}$ for \ce{MgCO3} is $4.0\times 10^{-5}$M. As such, $K_{sp}$ is smaller for \ce{PbBr2}. Differently, the solubility of \ce{MgCO3} is indeed smaller than the solubility of \ce{PbBr2}. This is because, the relationship between $K_{sp}$ and solubility is not linear. Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}1} reports solubility product constant values.
