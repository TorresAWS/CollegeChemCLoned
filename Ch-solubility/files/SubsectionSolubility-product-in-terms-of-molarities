Silver chloride, \ce{AgCl} is an insoluble compound in water which means this compound will not fully dissolve in water. Still, small quantities of the salt will indeed dissolve leading to a small amount of silver and chlorine ions. As this compound is insoluble the ion concentration will be very small. The dissociation equilibrium involved in the dissolution, indicate below, is characterized by an equilibrium constant $K_{sp}$ called \emph{solubility product constant} or simply \emph{solubility product}:
\begin{center}\ce{AgCl_{(s)}  <=> Ag^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)}}\hfill $K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Ag^+} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{Cl^-} \big]$\end{center}
As pure solids are not included in any equilibrium constant, the formula above does not include \ce{AgCl_{(s)}}. Hence, all solubility products simply result from the product of the molarities of the ions involved in the dissociation with the corresponding powers based on the stoichiometry of the salt. This is why the term \emph{product} is included on its name. $K_{sp}$ will have a different explicit expression depending on the formula of the insoluble compound--deppending on its stoichiometry. For example, $K_{sp}$ for calcium fluoride--a 1:2 compund--would be:
\begin{center}\ce{CaF2_{(s)}  <=> Ca^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2F^-_{(aq)}}\hfill $K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Ca^{2+}} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{F^-} \big]^2$\end{center}
Solubility products are related to the solubility of chemicals. However, the relation is not one-on-one. In other words, a larger $K_{sp}$ does not necessarely imply a larger solubility. For example, $K_{sp}$ for \ce{PbBr2} is $6.6\times 10^{-3}$M whereas $K_{sp}$ for \ce{MgCO3} is $4.0\times 10^{-5}$M. We have that $K_{sp}$ for \ce{PbBr2} is smaller than $K_{sp}$ for \ce{MgCO3}. However, the solubility of \ce{PbBr2} is indeed larger than the solubility of \ce{MgCO3}. Table \ref{tab:Table-Solubility-product} reports numerous solubility product constant values.
