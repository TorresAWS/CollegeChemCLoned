\item[\docfilehook{Solubility based on water volume}{}] Often we will find solubility expressed in terms of 100mL of water. For example, the solubility of Aluminium chloride is 45.8 g/100 mL at 20$^{\circ}$. This unit is defined with respect to the volume of water and ultimately is useful to find out the amount of solute that will dissolve in a given volume of water. For \ce{AlCl3}, we have that 45.8 grams of solute will dissolve in 100 mL of solvent.
