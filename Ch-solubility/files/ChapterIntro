For example, the presence of acids in the saliva enables tooth decay as they enhance the solubility of tooth enamel made of \ce{Ca5(PO4)3OH}. On a similar note, barium sulfate  \ce{BaSO4}, an insoluble compound, is opaque to x-rays and helps reveal digestive track issues. This chapter applies concepts of chemical equilibrium to the study of insoluble compounds. We will learn how to compute chemical solubilities using the equilibrium constant associated with the solubility equilibrium, and to assess the effect on the solubility of a common ion in solution.
