Insoluble compounds dissolve in small amounts in water. Solubility equilibrium is the equilibrium that describes the dissolution of an insoluble compound to produced an aqueous solution of ions. For example, for the case of silver chloride, we have:
\begin{center}\ce{AgCl_{(s)}  <=> Ag^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)}}	 \end{center}
The solubility equilibrium above represents the dissolution of the insoluble salt--a solid--to produce ions, silver and chloride in solution. In general terms, solubility equilibriums start with a solid and generate ions in solution. In order to break down the insoluble compound into ions, we just need to take into account the stoichiometry of the compound. For example, for the case of Cobalt(II) phosphate, we have:
\begin{center}\ce{Co3(PO4)2_{(s)}  <=> 3Co^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2PO4^{3-}_{(aq)}}	 \end{center}
