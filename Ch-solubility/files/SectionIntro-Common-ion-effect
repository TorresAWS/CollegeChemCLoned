The solubility value of an insoluble compound refers to the amount of ions produced by an insoluble compound when dissolved in clean water. Instead of clean water, we can think of a solution containing ions. If the ions have no relation with the solubility equilibrium, the value of solubility in pure water and a solution with ions will be the same. Differently, if the solution contains ions involved in the equilibrium, those will impact solubility. In particular, solubility will be reduced. This effect is referred to as the common ion effect. For example, the solubility of \ce{PbCl2} in pure water is $1.6\times 10^{-2}$M. In contrast, the solubility in a 0.1M \ce{NaCl} solution--a solution containing chloride a common ion--is $1.5\times 10^{-3}$M. Similarly, the solubility in a 0.5M \ce{NaCl} solution is $6.4\times 10^{-5}$M.
