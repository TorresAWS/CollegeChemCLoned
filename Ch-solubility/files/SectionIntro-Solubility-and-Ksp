The solubility product is the equilibrium constant associated to the solubility equilibrium. At the same time, the solubility product constant is related to the solubility of the insoluble compound and the relationship is not direct. This section will cover how to express $K_{sp}$ in terms of solubility, and at the same time, how to express solubility in terms of $K_{sp}$. Before that, we will start by addressing the idea of solubility.
