For any insoluble salt \ce{A_xB_y}, we have that $K_{sp}$ is related to $s$ by means of a general formula:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ K_{sp}= a\cdot s^b  }\label{\chapterlabel:equation2}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $a$  is $x^x\cdot y^y$
 \item $b$  is $x+y$
\end{where}
For example, for \ce{Ba1F2} the constant $a$ would be $1^1\cdot 2^2$, that is four, whereas the constant $b$ will be $1+2$ that equals to three. As such, the expression of $K_{sp}$ in terms of $s$ would be: $K_{sp}=4s^3$. This approach is useful when the we need to compute the solubility product constant given the molar solubility.
