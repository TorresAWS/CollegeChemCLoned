Insoluble compounds are in reality slightly soluble. As such, it exist an equilibrium that leads to the solubility of a so called insoluble compound, with a corresponding equilibrium constant called solubility product, $K_{sp}$. This section covers the obtention of the solubility product expression in terms of equilibrium concentrations of ions, and the relationship between this constant and the compound solubility. Ultimately, the goal would be to calculate the solubility value by means of the tabulated solubility constants. Unless otherwise stated, all solutions in this chapter are water-bases solutions at 298K--remember equilibrium constants are temperature and solvent dependent.
