At this point, we have used the solubility product to calculate the concentration of ions in a saturated solution of a solid. Imagine we have a solution containing a mixture of two different ions given that the ions in the solution can combine to form a precipitate. The question is, will a solid precipitate?  Similar to the solubility product, we can use a construct called the concentration product to predict whether a mixture of ions will  precipitate.
