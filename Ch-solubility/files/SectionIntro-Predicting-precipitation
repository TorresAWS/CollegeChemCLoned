Imagine we have a clear solution with any sign of precipitate. Now we add a second solution knowing that the mixture will produce a precipitate. The question here is when would the precipitate form. Some precipitates will form after adding just a few drops. Other would require a larger amount of reagents. Where is the limit for precipitation when we mix two reagents? As you can see is crucial to predict at what point of the addition will a precipitate form.
