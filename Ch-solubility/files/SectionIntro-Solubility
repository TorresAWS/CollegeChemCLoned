The solubility of an insoluble solute is the concentration of a saturated solution. A solution is saturated when no more solute can dissolve on it.  One can express solubility in two different ways, with respect to the solution and with respect to the solvent. 
If we refer solubility to the solution, we have two different solubility units: molar or mass-based solubility.
Molar solubility is the molarity of a saturated solution, whereas mass-based solubility--or simply solubility--is the concentration in grams per liter of a saturated solution. Both types of solubilities--molar and mass-based--are related.
If we refer to solubility with respect to the solvent, the solubility values are often expressed in g/100mL units, where mL refers to the volume of water.
