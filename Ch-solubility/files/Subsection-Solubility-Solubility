\item[\docfilehook{Solubility}{}] Molar solubility or simply solubility $s$ is defined as the moles of solute dissolved in 1L of a saturated solution. For example, the solubility of silver iodide (\ce{AgI}) at 25$^{\circ}$C is $9.0 \times 10^{-9}$ mol/L. This means that $9.0 \times 10^{-9}$ moles of silver iodide will dissolve in one liter of a saturated solution.
