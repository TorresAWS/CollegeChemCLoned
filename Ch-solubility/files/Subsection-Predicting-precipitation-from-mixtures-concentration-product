Let us analyze a situation in which we dissolve in water an insoluble compound such as lead(II) fluoride. The solubility products constant $K_{sp}$ is just an equilibrium constant that described the process of solubility, that is the dissolution of a solid. $K_{sp}$ depends on the equilibrium concentration of the ions in solution. With equilibrium, we mean that the concentrations were measured after a long long time, so that the system has reached equilibrium. For example, $K_{sp}$ for lead(II) fluoride is $3.3\times10^{-8}$ and its mathematical expression is presented below
\begin{center}\ce{PbF2{(s)}  <=> Pb^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2F^{-}_{(aq)}}\hfill $K_{sp}= \big[ \ce{Pb^{2+}} \big]\cdot \big[ \ce{F^{-}} \big]^2$= $3.3\times10^{-8}$\end{center}
In the expression above, $\big[ \ce{Pb^{2+}} \big]$ represents the equilibrium concentration of ions Lead(II) and $\big[ \ce{F^{-}} \big]$ is the equilibrium concentration of fluoride. These concentrations result from dissolving the insoluble chemical in water.
Let us now analyze a situation in which we have a mixture of ions containing 0.1M-\ce{Pb^{2+}} ions and 0.1M-\ce{F^{-}}. We want to assess if a precipitate will form, given that both ions can combine to produce lead(II) fluoride. To predict precipitation, we will use the reaction concentration product $Q_c$, and we will compare this product with the solubility product constant $K_{sp}$:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{  Q_{c}=\big[\text{Products}\big]_{noneq} } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{concentration product}}\label{\chapterlabel:equation4}
\end{equation}
A precipitate will appear only the computed $Q_c$ value is larger than $K_{sp}$. In other words, mixtures of solutions more concentrated that the compound's solubility will precipitate, whereas  less concentrated mixtures will not.

You might have noticed that $K_{sp}$ and $Q_c$ have a very similar formula. The difference beholds on the nature of the concentrations included in each of the formulas. $K_{sp}$ includes \emph{equilibrium} concentration, that is concentrations resulting of the slow dissolution of an insoluble compound measured after a long time, whereas $Q_c$ includes \emph{nonequilibrium} concentrations resulting of artificially preparing and quickly mixing ion solutions. For the example we are considering, after mixing a 0.1M-\ce{Pb^{2+}} solution and a 0.1M-\ce{F^{-}} solution, we have that  $Q_c$ is larger than $K_{sp}$ and therefore a precipitate will form:
\begin{center} $Q_{c}= \big[ \ce{Pb^{2+}} \big]_{noneq}\cdot \big[ \ce{F^{-}} \big]^2_{noneq}=0.1\cdot 0.1^2=1\times 10^{-3}>K_{sp}=3.3\times10^{-8}$ hence (\ce{v})\end{center}
Imaging that we mix now a $10^{-3}$M-\ce{Pb^{2+}} solution and a $10^{-3}$M-\ce{F^{-}} solution. For this case, we have that $Q_c$ is smaller than $K_{sp}$ and therefore no precipitate will form:
\begin{center} $Q_{c}= \big[ \ce{Pb^{2+}} \big]_{noneq}\cdot \big[ \ce{F^{-}} \big]^2_{noneq}=10^{-3}\cdot (10^{-3})^2=10^{-9}<K_{sp}=3.3\times10^{-8}$ hence (\cancel{\ce{v}})\end{center}
