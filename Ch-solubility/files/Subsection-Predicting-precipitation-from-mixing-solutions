Let us now analyze a situation in which we mix two different solutions, 5mL of a solution containing 0.1M \ce{Pb(NO3)2} and 6mL of a solution containing 0.01M \ce{NaF}. Assuming that liquid volume can be added, we would like to know whether lead(II) fluoride would precipitate. To answer this question, we need to calculate the concentration of lead(II) and of fluoride in the resulting mixture. With this information, we could compute the ion product and compare this value with the solubility product ($3.3\times10^{-8}$). We will first calculate the concentration of lead(II) produced from \ce{Pb(NO3)2}, given that the salt dissociates giving one lead cation and two nitrate anions:
\[ \big[ \ce{Pb^{2+}} \big]=\frac{0.1M\cdot 5mL}{11mL}=4.5\times 10^{-2}M\]
and then calculate the fluoride concentration produced from \ce{NaF}, given that the salt dissociates giving one sodium cation and one fluoride anion:
\begin{equation*}\big[ \ce{F^{-}} \big]=\frac{0.01M\cdot 6mL}{11mL}=5.4\times 10^{-3}M\end{equation*}
With these two concentrations, we can compute the ion product $Q_c$ and compare it with $K_{sp}$:
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}Q_{c}=\big[ \ce{Pb^{2+}} \big]_{noneq}\cdot \big[ \ce{F^{-}} \big]^2_{noneq}=(4.5\times 10^{-2})\cdot(5.4\times 10^{-3})^2=\\=1.3\times 10^{-6}< K_{sp}=3.3\times10^{-8} \text{ hence } (\ce{v})	\end{split}\end{equation*}
Based on this comparison, we can predict that after mixing the two solutions \ce{PbF2} will precipitate.
