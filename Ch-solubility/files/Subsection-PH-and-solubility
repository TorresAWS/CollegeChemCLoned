Some insoluble salts have acid-base character. For example, \ce{Ba(OH)2} is an insoluble salt with basic character--mind \ce{OH^-} is a base--and \ce{FeF2} is also a basic salt, as \ce{F^-} is a moderately strong base resulting from the dissociation of \ce{HF}, a weak acid. Therefore, for these salts, solubility is related to the PH. Only salts that result from weak acids or bases would have an acid-base character. For example, \ce{CaCO3} or \ce{CuCN} are all basic insoluble salts as carbonic acid and hydrocyanic acid are both weak acids. Let us calculate the PH of a \ce{Ba(OH)2} solution. We have that the solubility equilibrium is given by
\begin{center}\ce{	Ba(OH)2_{(s)} <=> Ba^{2+}_{(aq)}	+ 2OH^{-}_{(aq)}	}	\end{center}
and $K_{sp}$ is related to solubility $s$ by means the following formula
\[K_{sp}=4s^3			\]
As the solubility product of \ce{Ba(OH)2}  is $2.5\times10^{-4}$ we have that the solubility of the hydroxide is  0.04M. We have that the concentration of the ions in solution is related to solubility by
\begin{center}$\big[ \ce{Ba^{2+}}\big]=s$\hfill$\big[ \ce{OH^{-}}\big]=2s$\end{center}
Hence we have that the PH is directly related to solubility
\[POH=-log (\big[ \ce{OH^{-}}\big])=-log(2s)=1.09			\]
and PH will be 12.9.
For insoluble compounds with acid-base properties, PH affects solubility is affected by PH. In the example above, as \ce{Ba(OH)2} is a basic compound,Â  increasing PH towards even more basic values would impede the salt dissociation and hence decrease its solubility. Differently, decreasing PH would increase solubility as the amount of hydroxyls in solution would decrease and more hydroxyls would need to be formed.
