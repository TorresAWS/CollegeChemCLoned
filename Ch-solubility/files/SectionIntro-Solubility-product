Acid-base equilibrium have an acidity or a basicity constant associated. This equilibrium constant tells about the dissociation of the acid or base. Similarly, chemical reactions have an equilibrium constant associated which can be expressed in terms of concentrations or pressures. This equilibrium constant inform about the reacting mixture giving information about what is more more abundant in the mixture, either reactants or products. When a solid dissolved in liquid, this equilibrium also has an equilibrium constant associated. This time, the constant informs about the amount of solid that actually dissolves.
