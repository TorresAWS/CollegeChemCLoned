When an insoluble solid solves in liquid a solubility equilibrium establishes between the solid and the dissolved solid with an equilibrium constant associated. This equilibrium constant informs about the amount of solid that dissolves, which in general is small. Unless otherwise stated, all solutions in this chapter are water-based solutions at 25$^{\circ}$C--remember equilibrium constants are temperature and solvent-dependent.
