When an insoluble solid disolves in liquid a solubility equilibrium is established between the solid and the dissolved solid, and this equilibrium has associated an equilibrium constant. This equilibrium constant informs about the amount of solid that dissolves, which in general is small. Unless otherwise stated, all solutions in this chapter are water-based solutions at 25$^{\circ}$C--remember equilibrium constants are temperature and solvent-dependent.
