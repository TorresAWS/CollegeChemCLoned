\item[\docfilehook{Mass-based solubility}{}] Mass-based solubility $\overline{s}$ is defined as the number of grams of solute dissolved in a liter of a saturated solution. For example, the solubility of silver iodide (\ce{AgI}) at 25$^{\circ}$ is $2.1 \times 10^{-6}$ g/L. This means that $2.1 \times 10^{-6}$ grans of silver iodide will dissolve in one liter of a saturated solution.
