 For the galvanic cell below, indicate:  
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item label the electrode as anode and cathode
\item identify the flow of electrons
\item identify the flow of cations and anions
\item identify the oxidation and reduction
 \end{inparaenum}

 \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item The electrode labeled with the $-$ sign located on the left is the anode, where the oxidation takes place. Electrons are being produced in the anode and cations are also being generated in the anode (or perhaps anions are being consumed, it depends on the redox reaction happening). The electrode labeled with the $+$ sign located on the right is the cathode, where the reduction takes place. Electrons are consumed in the cathode and anions are also being generated in the cathode.
\item The flow of electrons goes from the anode on the left to the cathode on the right
\item Cations are being produced in the anode and they have a tendency to migrate towards the cathode. Anions are being produced in the cathode and they have a tendency to migrate towards the anode.
\item The oxidation takes place on the anode on the left, whereas the reduction takes place on the cathode on the left.
