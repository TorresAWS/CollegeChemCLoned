How much time should a 3A current be applied in order to produce $5\times 10^{-4}$ moles of Zinc in a Danielle electrolytic cell? 
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We will start by using the reaction stoichiometry to convert the moles of Zn produced into moles of electrons flowing through the cell (given that two electrons are involved in the redox reaction), to then convert the moles of electrons into coulombs using Faraday's constant, and the coulombs into ampers: 
 \begin{equation*}\begin{split}
5\times 10^{-4}   \cancel{\text{moles of Zn } } \times 
\dfrac{2 \cancel{\text{ moles of }e^-}  } {  1 \cancel{\text{mole of Zn } }} 
\times\dfrac{96485 \text{ C }  }{1\cancel{\text{ moles of }e^-}}
\times\dfrac{1\text{ s }  }{3\text{ C }}
=32.16\text{s }  
\end{split}\end{equation*}
