There is a quick and easy way to represent a galvanic cell without having to draw the whole cell diagram. This is called the line notation and galvanic cells are represented in a single line, starting from left to right. The anode is presented in the left, starting from the metallic part and followed by the electrolyte. A single line represents the liquid-solid contact. A double line represents the salt bridge and the cathode is represented in the right, starting for the electrolyte and finishing by the metal. As you can see, the line notation respect all interphase present in the cells: from left to right we have solid, liquid in contact with the salt bridge which is in contact with the liquid part of the cathode and finally we have the solid part of the cathode.
For example, the line notation of Daniell cell is:
\begin{center}\ce{Zn}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in} \ce{Zn^{2+}}\text{(1 M)}\hspace{.02 in}||\hspace{.02 in}\ce{Cu^{2+}}\text{(1 M)}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in}\ce{Cu}	\end{center}
In case there are several electrolytes in any of the electrodes, as all species are in liquid phase we separate them with just a comma. For example, in the galvanic cell below the cathode contains two different states of iron and uses Pt for the charge transfer:
\begin{center}\ce{Zn}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in} \ce{Zn^{2+}}\text{(1 M)}\hspace{.02 in}||\hspace{.02 in}\ce{Fe^{2+}}, \ce{Fe^{3+}}\text{(1 M)}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in}\ce{Pt}	\end{center}
Gases should also be included in the notation with their corresponding pressure. For example, the hydrogen electrode would be written as:
\begin{center}\ce{Pt}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in} \ce{H2}\text{(1 atm)}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in}\ce{H^{+}    }\text{(1 M)}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in} 	\end{center}
