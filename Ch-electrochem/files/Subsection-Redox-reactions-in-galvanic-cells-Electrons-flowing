The number of electrons flowing in a galvanic cell--specifically the moles of electrons flowing--deppends on the electrons produced in the anode and consumed in the cathode. Given that the overall charge of the cell needs to be conserved:
\begin{center}
 \ce{	3V_{(s)} + 2Au^{3+}_{(aq)} + \Cancel{6e^-} <=>	 3V^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2Au_{(s)}+ \Cancel{6e^-}}  
\end{center}
In the example above, for the gold-vanadium galvanic cell, we have that gold consumes three moles of electrons and vanadium produces two moles of electrons, overall six moles of electrons flow through the cell.
