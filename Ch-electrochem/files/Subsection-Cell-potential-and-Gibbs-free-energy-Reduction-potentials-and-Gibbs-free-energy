The cell potential of a galvanic cell represents the voltage experienced by the electrons flowing through the cell. The voltage or potential difference--volts are the SI units--is a force that drives the electric flow. In other words, the potential difference generated by a galvanic cell tells about the work needed to carry an electric charge in the cell. A Volt is defined as one joule (J) per coulomb (C) of charge. The maximum amount of work that an electron can do in a galvanic cell is given by the potential difference of the cell times the charge.
At the same time, in chemistry, the maximum--nonexpansive--work that a system can do, in reversible conditions, is given by the Gibbs free energy. As both the cell voltage and Gibbs free energy are related to the work generated in the cell, it is simple to see how both thermodynamic functions are related:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\Delta G^{\circ}=-n_e\cdot F\cdot \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cell}
   }\label{\chapterlabel:equation2}
\end{equation} 
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $n_e$   is the number of moles of electrons flowing through the cell
 \item $F$   is Faraday's constant ($9.6485\times 10^{4}$C/mol), a constant used to convert from moles of electrons to coulombs (a charge unit)
 \item $\Delta G^{\circ}$   is the standard Gibbs free energy change (in J)
 \item $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cell}$   is the standard cell voltage (in V)
\end{where}
For example, for the redox reaction happening in a galvanic cell:
\begin{center}
 \ce{	3V_{(s)} + 2Au^{3+}_{(aq)} + 6e^- <=>	 3V^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2Au_{(s)}+ 6e^-} \hfill  $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cell}=$2.65V
\end{center}
we have that the cell voltage if 2.65V. As there are six moles of electron flowing through the cell, we have that the change in Gibbs free energy in this reaction would be:
\[ \Delta G^{\circ}=-n_e\cdot F\cdot \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cell}= -6\cdot 9.6485\times 10^{4}\cdot 2.65=-1534111.5J=-1534KJ \]
The negative sign in the Formula \ref{\chapterlabel:equation2} is critical. As cell voltages can only be positive numbers, Gibbs free energy changes for working--spontaneously--galvanic cells will always be negative. At the same time, Formula \ref{\chapterlabel:equation2}  gives the maximum work produced by a galvanic cell working at reversible conditions. In other words, real working cells that produce electricity will always produce voltage lower than the one given by Formula \ref{\chapterlabel:equation2}, as these do not function reversibly. Finally, there exist an equivalent formula to Formula \ref{\chapterlabel:equation2} without the standard sign for conditions different than the standard ones.
