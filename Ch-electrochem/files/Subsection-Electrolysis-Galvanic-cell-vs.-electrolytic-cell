A galvanic cell generates voltage through a spontaneous redox reaction. The electrons are produced in the anode and consumed in the cathode. Anions migrate towards the anode and cations towards the cathode. A voltmeter is used to measure the cell voltage.
An electrolytic cell uses an externally applied voltage to force a nonspontaneous redox reaction with a negative voltage. Electrolysis has many applications in science, such as battery charging, metal extraction, production of non-metals, or metal refining. In an electrolytic cell, electrons still flow from the anode to the cathode, and anions also migrate towards the anode, whereas cathodes migrate towards the anode. However, the anode in an electrolytic cell becomes the cathode in the equivalent galvanic cell, whereas the electrolytic cathode becomes the galvanic anode. This is because the externally applied voltage reverts the nature of the electrodes.
