Electrolysis is a process in which an electric current is forced through a chemical system to induce a chemical reaction that otherwise would not happen spontaneously. Galvanic cells and electrolytic cells follow an opposite sign notation, with anodes being labeled with a positive sign and cathodes with a negative sign in electrolytic cells. Furthermore, the galvanic anode becomes the electrolytic cathode, whereas the galvanic cathode becomes the electrolytic anode.
