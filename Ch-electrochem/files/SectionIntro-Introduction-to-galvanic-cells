Galvanic cells--also known as voltaic cells or piles--are electrochemical cells that generate electricity from spontaneous redox reactions. They contain two different metals immersed in electrolyte solutions. Each half-cell contains a metal in contact with a liquid solution of the same metal in ionic form. Both half-cells are either connected by a salt bridge or separated by a porous membrane. Galvanic cells differ from batteries. Batteries are composed of multiple single cells working out of equilibrium while producing electricity. Galvanic cells are textbook batteries. They are reversible devices unable to produce electricity.
