The standard reduction potential of an electrode predicts the tendency of an electrod to act as an anode or cathode. Imagine we have two different electrodes involving the following reaction with the standard potentials indicated on the side, and we need to set up a galvanic cell:
\begin{center}\ce{Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^- ->Cu_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=+$0.34V\\
\ce{Zn^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^- ->Zn_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-$0.76V\end{center}
How to determine which electrode will act as anode and which will act as cathode? The rule is the smaller the electrode potential the more tendency of the electrode to act as an anode. If we compare the copper and zinc electrodes, as the electrode potential of zinc is smaller--more negative--than the electrode potential of copper. Therefore, zinc will act as an anode and copper will act as a cathode.
The standard reduction potential is not affected by the stoichiometry of the reaction. For example, the standard reduction potential of cesium is $-$3.03V:
\begin{center}\ce{	Cs^+	+e^-	 <=>	Cs_{(s)}	}\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-$3.03V\end{center}
At the same time, the standard reduction potential of two moles of cesium is still $-$3.03V.
 \begin{center}\ce{	2Cs^+	+2e^-	 <=>	2Cs_{(s)}	}\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-$3.03V\end{center}
Differently, inverting the reduction reaction switches the sign of the reduction potential. For example, the standard reduction potential of Titanium(II) is $-$1.63V
\begin{center}\ce{Ti^{2+} + 2   e^-	 <=>	Ti_{(s)}	}\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-$1.63V\end{center}
while the standard potential of oxidation of Titanium into Titanium(II) is $+$1.63V
\begin{center}\ce{Ti_{(s)}	 <=>	Ti^{2+} + 2   e^-	}\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=+$1.63V\end{center}
