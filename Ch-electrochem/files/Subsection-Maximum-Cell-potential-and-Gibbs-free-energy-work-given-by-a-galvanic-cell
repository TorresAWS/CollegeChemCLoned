Galvanic cells produce electricity and hence they generate work. The maximum work produced by a galvanic cell is given by:
 \begin{equation}
\boxed{
w_{max}=-n_e\cdot F\cdot \mathcal{E}_{cell}
   }\label{\chapterlabel:equation3}
\end{equation} 
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $n_e$   is the number of moles of electrons flowing through the cell
 \item $F$   is Faraday's constant ($9.6485\times 10^{4}$C/mol), a constant used to convert from moles of electrons to coulombs (a charge unit)
 \item $w_{max}$   is the maximum work produced by the cell (in J)
 \item $\mathcal{E} _{cell}$   is the  cell voltage (in V)
\end{where}
For example, a galvanic cell that produced 3V with a flow of 4 electrons can generate less than
\[ w_{max}=-n_e\cdot F\cdot \mathcal{E}_{cell}= -4\cdot 9.6485\times 10^{4}\cdot 3=-1157820J.=-116KJ \]
 The negative sign on the formula indicates that work is being produced (and not consumed).
