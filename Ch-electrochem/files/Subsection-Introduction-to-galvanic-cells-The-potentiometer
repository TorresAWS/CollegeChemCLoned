Voltmeters are devices used to measure cell potential, the number of Volts, in electric circuits. These devices work by drawing current through a know resistance. Voltmeter can not be used to precisely measure the voltage of a galvanic cell. As electricity flows into the voltmeter, frictional heating will occur and energy will be wasted. Hence the voltage measured would be lower than the real voltage. In order to avoid this problem in a lab setting, we normally use potentiometers to measure galvanic cells. Potentiometers apply a counter-voltage to compensate the cell voltage without drawing any significant current. Due to their high internal resistivity, there is no electricity flow in a voltaic cell connected to a voltmeter. The cell remains in equilibrium, and the electrodes are not consumed. Still, an ammeter could be used to measure the tendency of the cell to generate a measurable intensity flow, the Amperes.
