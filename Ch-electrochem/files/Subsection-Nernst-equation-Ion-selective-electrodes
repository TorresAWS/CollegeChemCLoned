Ion-selective electrodes are electrochemical electrodes sensitive to a given ion. One example is the hydrogen electrode, which electrodic voltage varies depending on the PH of the solution in the cell. This principle is used in PH meters, chemical instruments employed to measure the PH of aqueous solutions. A PH meter contains an electrochemical cell--a glass electrode--in which one of the electrodes is sensitive to protons and the other electrode is kept as a reference inside a glass bulb that can be dipped onto solutions. One can use several electrodes as a reference, with fixed molarities. The reference electrode makes contact with the external solution by means of a miniature salt bridge. A common one is the calomel electrode:
\begin{center}\ce{Hg2Cl2_{(s)}}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in} \ce{Au^{Cl-}}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in}\ce{Hg_{(l)}  }\hspace{.02 in}||\hspace{.02 in}  \hfill 	$\mathcal{E}^{\circ}  =$0.27V	\end{center}
The redox reaction behind this electrode is:
\begin{center}\ce{	H2Cl2_{(s)} + 2e^- +   -> 2H^{+}_{(aq)}  + 2Hg_{(l)}   }\end{center}
Another common reference electrode is the \ce{Ag}/\ce{AgCl} electrode:
\begin{center}\ce{Ag_{(s)}}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in} \ce{AgCl_{(s)}}\hspace{.02 in}|\hspace{.02 in}\ce{Cl^{-}_{(aq)}  }\hspace{.02 in}||\hspace{.02 in} \hfill 	$\mathcal{E}  =$0.197V\end{center}
PH meters need to be calibrated with buffer solutions of a known PH, and their potential varies linearly with PH. There are other ion-sensitive electrodes that can be used to detect a variety of ions such as ammonium, calcium or sodium.
