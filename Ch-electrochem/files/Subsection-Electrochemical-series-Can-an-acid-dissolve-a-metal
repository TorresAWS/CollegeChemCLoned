Let us compare the standard redox potential for two different redox pairs: the reduction of ionic zinc into metallic zinc and the reduction of a proton (found in any acid) into hydrogen
\begin{center}\ce{	Zn^{2+} + 2   e^-	 <=>	Zn_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1}=-$0.762V\\
\ce{2H+ + 2   e^-	 <=>	H2_{(g)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}=+$0.00V\end{center} 
The reduction potential of zinc is smaller than the reduction of protons. This means that hydrogen has a stronger tendency to reduced than zinc, and hence when pairing both elements, zinc will likely dissolve in a solution containg an acid, at standard conditons.
By comparing a redox pair with the origin of the reduction scale, we can find out whether an element will dissolve in simple nonoxidizing acids (e.g. \ce{HCl}). If the redox potential of the metal is lower than zero then the metal will dissolve. For example, aluminum, lead, or iron will dissolve in HCl. Differently, gold or silver will not.
We have called HCl a nonoxidizing element. Other acids such as \ce{HNO3} are called oxidizing acids. This is because its reduction potential is higher than zero, and as such, they have a stronger capacity to oxidize metals than hydrochloric acid. Still, we can find out whether gold or silver will be dissolved in nitric acid by comparing both redox pairs:
\begin{center}
\ce{	Au+ +e^-	 <=>	Au_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1}=+$1.83V\\
\ce{	Ag+ +e^-	 <=>	Ag_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}=+$0.80V\\
\ce{NO_3^-_{(aq)} + 2H+ +e^-	 <=>	NO2_{(g)} + H2O }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{3}=+$0.80V\end{center} 
We have that nitroc acid will dissolve silver ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}\simeq \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{3}$) but not gold ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1} > \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{3}$).
