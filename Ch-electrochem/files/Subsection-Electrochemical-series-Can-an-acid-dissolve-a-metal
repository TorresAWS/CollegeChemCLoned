Let us compare the standard redox potential for two different redox pairs: the reduction of ionic zinc into metallic zinc and the reduction of a proton (found in any acid) into hydrogen
\begin{center}\ce{	Zn^{2+} + 2   e^-	 <=>	Zn_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1}=-$0.762V\\
\ce{2H+ + 2   e^-	 <=>	H2_{(g)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}=+$0.00V\end{center} 
The redox potential of zinc is smaller than the potential of protons. In other words, hydrogen has a stronger oxidizing character than zinc, and zinc has a stronger reducing character than hydrogen. This means that hydrogen would oxidize zinc producing \ce{Zn^{2+}} and reduce itself producing \ce{H2_{(g)}}, and hence when pairing both elements, zinc will likely dissolve in a solution containg an acid, at standard conditons.
By comparing a redox pair with the origin of the reduction scale, we can find out whether a metal will dissolve in simple acids (nonoxidizing acidsm e.g. \ce{HCl}). If the redox potential of the metal is lower than zero then the metal will dissolve in acid. For example, aluminum, lead, or iron will dissolve in HCl. Differently, gold or silver will not.
HCl is a nonoxidizing acid. Other acids such as \ce{HNO3} are called oxidizing acids as they have a stronger oxidizing character than hydrochloric acid--a larger redox potential (0.80V). This is because its reduction potential is higher than zero, and as such, they have a stronger capacity to oxidize metals than hydrochloric acid. For example, we can find out whether gold or silver will be dissolved in nitric acid by comparing both redox pairs:
\begin{center}
\ce{	Au+ +e^-	 <=>	Au_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1}=+$1.83V\\
\ce{	Ag+ +e^-	 <=>	Ag_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}=+$0.80V\\
\ce{NO_3^-_{(aq)} + 2H+ +e^-	 <=>	NO2_{(g)} + H2O }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{3}=+$0.80V
\end{center} 
We have that nitric acid will dissolve silver ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}\simeq \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{3}$) but not gold ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1} > \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{3}$).
