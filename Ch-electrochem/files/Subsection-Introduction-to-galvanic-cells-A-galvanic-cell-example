Below we display a representation of the Daniell cell, a classical galvanic cell in which copper is oxidized by zinc. The name of the cell is in honor of John Daniell, a British chemist from the nineteenth century who was trying to develop an electric power supply to sustain telegraphy. He connected with a metallic wire a zinc electrode in contact with a zinc sulfate solution to a copper electrode in contact with a copper (II) sulfate solution. In this cell, Copper(II) ions are converted into metallic copper in the cathode by means of the reaction \ce{Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^- -> Cu_{(s)}}, whereas metallic zinc is converted into zinc ions in the anode following the reaction \ce{Zn_{(s)} -> Zn^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^-  	}. Copper(II) ions are being reduced whereas zinc is being oxidized. The cathode solution becomes negatively charged whereas the anode solution becomes positively charged. A porous membrane permeable to ions was used to avoid the charge buildup.
