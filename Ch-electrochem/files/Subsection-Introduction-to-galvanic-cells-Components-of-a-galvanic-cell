Galvanic cells are composed of two different electrodes, an anode, and a cathode, connected by means of a salt bridge or a membrane. The role of the salt bridge or membrane is to complete the electrical circuit. Anodes are sources of electrons, whereas cathodes are electron sinks. At the same time, anodes generate positive cations, whereas cathodes generate negative anions. 
The role of the salt bridge or membrane is also to allow the charges generated in the cathode to be compensated by the charges generated in the anode. 
Electrodes contain two different redox states of the same element in contact with each other. An example of an electrode would be a piece of metallic copper \ce{Cu} in contact with a solution of \ce{Cu^{2+}_{(aq)}} ions. However, electrodes are not always made of metals. For example, electrodes can contain gas in contact (e.g. \ce{H2_{(g)}}) with an electrolyte solution (e.g. \ce{H^+_{(aq)}}). Electrodes without a metall being directly involved in the redox reaction need to include an external metall to support the charge transfer. Metals such as \ce{Pt} are normally used for this purpose.
