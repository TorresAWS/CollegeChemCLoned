In a galvanic cell, each electrode--also called half-cell--has a given potential. When combining two electrodes, we obtain the measurable cell potential. This magnitude represents the force that pushed electrons from the anode to the cathode producing a measurable current. This section covers electrode potentials. We will define the concept of electrode potential, and we will identify the anode and cathode when two electrodes are in contact based on the electrode potentials.
