Water flows down a waterfall due to the difference of potential energy between the high and low parts of the waterfall. Similarly, heat flows between a hot and a cold reservoir due to the difference in temperature between both locations. The force that drives the flow is heat is temperature. Electricity flows through a galvanic cell resulting from the difference of cell potential $\Delta \mathcal{E}$ between both electrodes, the anode, and the cathode. The cell potential--also referred to as cell voltage, cell electromotive force, or cell \emph{emf}--is the force that drives the flow of electrons. Anodes and cathodes have a characteristic cell potential associated with the electrochemical half-reaction happening in the electrode. The voltage of the anode ($\mathcal{E}_{anode}$) is always lower than the one from the cathode  ($\mathcal{E}_{cathode}$). The combination of the anodic and cathodic voltage gives the overall cell potential measured in a galvanic cell. In particular, the overall voltage results from the voltage of the cathode with respect to the anode, so that the overall voltage of a galvanic cell is always positive.
