Water molecules can be split into gas hydrogen and oxygen. The oxidation of water produces oxygen,
\begin{center}\ce{	H2O_{(l)}     ->  O2_{(g)}  + 4H^{+}_{(aq)} + 4e^-   }\hfill $-\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$=-1.23\end{center}
and the reduction of water produces hydrogen,
\begin{center}\ce{	4H2O_{(l)}   + 4e^-   ->  2H2_{(g)}  + 4OH^{-}_{(aq)}   }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$=-0.83\end{center}
Overall, the potential needed to split water is $-2.06$V. However, this number is calculated at standard conditions, and at neutral PH one needs a more positive value (close to 1.2V). Still, electrochemical processes are affected by overvoltage. That means that in order to electrolyze water we need more than 1.2V, being the difference between the needed value and the value calculated using electrochemistry the overvoltage or overpotential. This effect is due to electron transfer limitations from the solution to the electrode that increases the measured voltage needed. At the same time, pure water does not contain enough ions to conduct the electricity and in order to foster the flow of electricity, we need to add ions in the form of an acid or an electrolyte.
