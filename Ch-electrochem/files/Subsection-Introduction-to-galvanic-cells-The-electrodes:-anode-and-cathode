Every galvanic cell is composed of two electrodes: an anode and a cathode. Electrodes produce ionic and electronic charges.  The oxidation occurs on the anode which is indicated with a negative ($-$) sign. Electrons are being produced in the anode resulting from an oxidation reaction. The reduction occurs on the cathode, indicated with a positive ($+$) sign. Electrons are being consumed in the cathode resulting from a reduction reaction. These electrodes also produce ions, in particular cations and anions which have a tendency to migrate inside the cell. Anodes generate cations (and consume anions, depending on the chemical reaction involved), whereas cathodes generate anions (and consume cations, again, depending on the chemical reaction involved). As such, anions have a tendency to migrate to the anode, as their concentration is lower there, whereas cations have a tendency to migrate to the cathode. The excess ionic charge is compensated in the interface between the electrode and the salt bridge or the membrane. Mind that in a galvanic cell only electrons flow through the circuit, by means of the wire connecting both electrodes. The ions involved have a tendency to migrate inside each of the electrodes but do not leave the electrode. The name of the electrodes--anode and cathode--results from the ionic flow involved in the galvanic cell: anions have a tendency to migrate towards the anode and cations to the cathode.
