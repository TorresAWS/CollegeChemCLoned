A galvanic cell consists of two electrodes, an anode, and a cathode. Each electrode contains two chemical species with different redox numbers in contact through an interface. For example, we can build up an electrode by soaking a piece of metallic copper on a solution of copper(II) sulfate. The interface consist of the liquid phase containing \ce{Cu^{2+}_{(aq)}} in contact with the metal phase made of \ce{Cu_{(s)}}. Each electrode has a reduction potential--$\mathcal{E}$, expressed in volts (V)--that informs about the drive of the redox process in the electrode. The larger this value the stronger the tendency of the redox process to occur.
