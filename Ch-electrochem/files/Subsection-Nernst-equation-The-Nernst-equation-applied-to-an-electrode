The Nernst equation gives the dependence of the cell voltage with the concentration of the ions involved in the redox reaction behind the cell, and with temperature. As such, it is used to compute cell voltage outside the standard conditions. The Nernst equation is given by:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
 \mathcal{E}= \mathcal{E}^{\circ}-\frac{R\cdot T}{n_e\cdot F}\ln Q
   }\label{\chapterlabel:equation5}
\end{equation} 
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\mathcal{E}$  is the cell voltage (in V)
 \item $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$   is the standard cell voltage (in V)
 \item $R$   is the constant of the gases in energy units (8.314J/molK)
 \item $T$   is the absolute temperature (kelvins)
 \item $F$   is Faraday's constant ($9.6485\times 10^{4}$C/mol)
 \item $n_e$   is the number of electrons in the redox reaction
 \item $Q=\frac{\text{Products}}{\text{Reactants}}$   is the reaction quotient
 \item $\frac{R\cdot T}{F}$   is 0.025693V at 298.15K
\end{where}
For example, for the electrodic reaction representing the oxygen reduction, the standard voltage at standard conditions ($\large[\ce{H^+}\large]$=1M and $p_{\ce{O2}}=$1atm, mind these are very acidic conditions) is given by:
\begin{center}\ce{	4H^{+}_{(aq)} + 4e^- + O2_{(g)} -> 2H2O_{(l)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=+$1.23V\end{center}
However, at $\large[\ce{H^+}\large]$=$10^{-7}$M (neutral PH) the electrodic voltage is lower
 
\[\mathcal{E}= \mathcal{E}^{\circ}-\frac{R\cdot T}{n_e\cdot F}\ln Q = 1.23-\frac{8.314\cdot 298.15}{4\cdot 96485}\ln \frac{1}{\large( 10^{-7}\large) ^{4}}=0.81V\]
Hence, it is easier to reduce oxygen at neutral PH than it is at very acidic PH.
\begin{center}\ce{	4H^{+}_{(aq)} + 4e^- + O2_{(g)} -> 2H2O_{(l)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}=+$0.81V\end{center} 
In general, for electrodic reactions involving a single cation, the molarity of this ion will be placed on the bottom of $Q$. For electrodict reactions involving a single anion, the molarity of this ion will be placed on the top of $Q$.
