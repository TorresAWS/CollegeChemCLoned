Electrolysis is used to plate metal surfaces in a setup in which we have a solution containing a mixture of ions and by applying an external voltage one of the metals is deposited. Normally, the voltage is increased from zero and the first ions to deposit are those with higher-more positive--standard reduction potential. For example, in a mixture of \ce{Na^+} ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$-=2.71V), \ce{Au^+} ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$=1.52V) and \ce{Pt^{2+}} ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$=1.2V), gold would be plated first.
