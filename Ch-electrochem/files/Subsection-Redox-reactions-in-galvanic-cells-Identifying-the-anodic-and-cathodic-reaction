 Let us assume we need to build up a galvanic cell based on the following reactions:
\begin{center}\ce{V^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^-	 <=>	V_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-$1.13V\\
\ce{Au^{3+}_{(aq)} + 3e^-	 <=>	Au_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=+$1.52V\end{center}
We want to will identify the anodic and the cathodic reaction. To do this we should compare the magnitude of the standard reduction potentials for both reactions, the larger this value the larger the tendency of the reaction to proceed as a reduction, and hence the larger the tendency of the electrode based on that reaction to act as a cathode. We have that the reduction of vanadium has a standard reduction potential of -$1.13$V, whereas the standard reduction potential for the reduction of gold is +$1.52$V. An electrode made of a piece of vanadium in contact with a solution of vanadium(II) would be the anode and an electrode made of a piece of gold in contact with a solution of gold(III) would be the cathode. Now we can label the reactions as anode and cathode:
\begin{center}\ce{V^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^-	 <=>	V_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{anode}=-$1.13V\\
\ce{Au^{3+}_{(aq)} + 3e^-	 <=>	Au_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cathode}=+$1.52V\end{center}
