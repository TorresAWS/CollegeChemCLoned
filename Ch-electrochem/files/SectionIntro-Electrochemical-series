Metals dissolve forming ions. The dissolution of a metal involves a redox reaction in which a metallic element transforms into its ionic state. During this process, on one hand, the metal loses electrons producing cations and hence the metal is being oxidized. On the other hand, the solvent reduces. Acids contain protons that can reduce to hydrogen. Indeed, one can use acids to dissolve metals like using water to dissolve table salt. However, not all acids will dissolve a given metal. The electrochemical series is a list of redox pairs going from low standard reduction potential to high standard reduction potential. Using this series, we can find out whether a metal will be dissolved by an acid.
