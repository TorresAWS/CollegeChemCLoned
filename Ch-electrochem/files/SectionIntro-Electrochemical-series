When a metal dissolves it becomes ions. In other words, a dissolving metal is part of a redox reaction in which a metallic element transforms into its ionic state. During this process, on one hand, the metal loses electrons while producing cations and hence the metal is being oxidized. On the other hand, the solvent becomes reduces. Acids contain protons that can be reduced to produce hydrogen. This way, one can use acids to dissolve metals like using water to dissolve table salt. However, not all acids will dissolve a given metal. The electrochemical series is a list of redox pairs going from low standard reduction potential to high standard reduction potential. In particular, using this series we can find out whether a metal will be dissolved by an acid.
