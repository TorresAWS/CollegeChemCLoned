One of the uses of standard reduction potentials ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$) is to compute standard Gibbs free energy changes from galvanic cell potentials. Another use is to calculate the equilibrium constant ($K$) from electrochemical data. As standard reduction potentials are related to standard Gibbs free energies and $\Delta G^{\circ}$ is related to the equilibrium constant, we can conclude that $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$ is related to $K$. We use the following equation to compute equilibrium constants from electrochemical data:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\ln K=\frac{n_e\cdot F\cdot \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cell}}{RT} 
   }\label{\chapterlabel:equation4}
\end{equation} 
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $K$   is the equilibrium constant
 \item $n_e$   is the number of electrons (a pure number) flowing through the cell
 \item $F$   is Faraday's constant ($9.6485\times 10^{4}$C/mol)
 \item $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cell}$   is the standard cell voltage (in V)
 \item $R$   is the constant of the gases in energy units (8.314J/molK)
 \item $T$   is the absolute temperature (kelvins)
\end{where}
  For example, the reduction of zinc(II) to give metallic zinc is given by:
\begin{center}\ce{Zn^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^- -> Zn_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-$0.76V\end{center}
We can obtain the standard equilibrium constant at 298K by doing:
\[\ln K=\frac{n_e\cdot F\cdot \mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{cell}}{RT} =\frac{2\cdot 96485\cdot \large( -0.76\large) }{8.314\cdot 298}=-59.19\]
Hence the value of the equilibrium constant at 298K would be $1.96\times 10^{26}$. As $K$ is lower than one, this means that at 298K ionic zinc will not undergo the reduction process spontaneously, and there are more reactants than products in equilibrium.
