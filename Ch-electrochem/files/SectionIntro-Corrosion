Metals corrode when returning to their original state as found in nature, in the form of oxides, sulfides, silicates, and carbonates. This complex mixture of solids is called ore. When a metal corrodes, it oxidizes. Corrosion has a severe impact on the value and properties of metals, as rusted metals often lose their integrity. Metals corrode when they oxidize, producing rust. 
Most structural and decorative metals (e.g. Ag, Fe, Ni, Cu, etc) spontaneously rust. They have a reduction potential lower than that of oxygen gas ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=1.2$V), which means they have a stronger tendency to become oxidized while oxygen reduces to water--they have a strong reducing capacity. Cooper forms Platina, a greenish copper carbonate. Silver forms silver tarnish, a silver sulfide (\ce{Ag2S}). Rust is a hydrated iron(II) oxide of complex composition (\ce{Fe2O3.nH2O}). Zinc forms a mixture of oxide and carbonate coatings. Gold is the only metal that does not oxidize under normal conditions, due to its high redox potential ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=1.5$V).
As metals oxidize very easily under atmospheric conditions, a thin layer of rust--a coating--prevents the complete oxidation of the metal as they have a higher--less negative--reduction potential. For example, metallic aluminum ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-1.7$V) is naturally coated with aluminum oxide (\ce{Al2O3}). This oxide ($\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=-0.6$V) passivates the metal preventing its further oxidation. Still, this protective effect is not infallible as natural coatings are irregular and they scale off exposing the uncorroded metal to the air.
Oxygen and moisture, among other factors, are responsible for the corrosion of iron. The corrosion of iron can be understood by thinking more about the functioning of a galvanic cell than on a pure oxidation process. Some areas of an iron surface are more easily oxidized than others, due to a lack of homogeneity. These areas are called anodic areas, and metallic iron oxidizes there forming iron(II)  as well as electrons, which can flow in the metal. Iron(II) ions can also migrate on the surface of iron due to moisture that acts as a salt bridge. Moisture is critical for the corrosion of iron as it is necessary for ionic migration. The presence of other electrolytes such as sodium chloride can also favor the corrosion of iron due to the formation of complex iron compounds. For example, it is well known that salt on the road favors the corrosion of cars and that cars decay faster in humid weather. In the cathodic regions, iron(II) reacts with oxygen and moisture to produce rust, iron oxide. The degree of hydration of the oxide affects the color of rust, varying from black, to yellow or red. The anodic regions and cathodic regions are not necessarily close to each other. That is why rust grows in remote areas from the metal pits that start the corrosion.
There are several methods to prevent corrosion. The application of coatings in the form of paints, metal plating, galvanization, or alloying can help prevent corrosion. Cr and Sn are used to plate still as they form regular and durable oxide coatings. Zn is used to galvanize iron, as Zn has a stronger tendency to be oxidized than iron. Cr and Ni are alloyed with steel to produce stainless steel.
Another method to prevent corrosion is called cathodic protection. When connecting a metal that needs to be protected to a more reducing metal, a metal that can be oxidized easily, the more reducing metal acts as the anode, oxidizing first while protecting the less reducing metal. This technique is used to protect ship's hulls or steel in pipelines.
