Galvanic cells consist of an anode and a cathode. The anode carries the oxidation reaction hence producing electrons. The cathode carries the reduction reaction hence consuming electrons. Overall, the number of electrons produced by the anode compensated for the number of electrons consumed by the cathode. so that electrons do not accumulate in the cell. When obtaining the overall redox reaction from two reduction reactions we need to operate in order to take into account the oxidation carried in the anode and the conservation of charge.
