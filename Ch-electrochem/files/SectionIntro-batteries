Batteries are portable sources of electrical power. They consist of a series of galvanic cells connected in series so that the overall voltage results from the added voltage of the small cells. They are used to power a variety of essential devices, from small electric calculators to large electric cars.

Lead batteries have been extensively used in car manufacturing since the early twenty century to self-start cars. These large and heavy batteries function under a wide range of temperatures and harsh conditions on the road, with a useful life of between 3 to 5 years. Each battery typically contains six galvanic cells, each giving about 2V, combined with an overall high voltage of about 12V. The anode is made of a lead grid, whereas the cathode is made of a metallic lead grid, coated with lead(II) oxide. Both electrodes are submerged in a sulfuric acid solution. When the battery works sulfuric acid is consumed, whereas water is being consumed as the battery charges. Traditional batteries require the periodic addition of water. The density of the sulfuric acid solutions gives an estimate of the battery conditions, as the sulfuric density decreases with use. When cars run, an alternator is used to electrolyze the battery, forcing current during recharging. One of the side reactions occurring when jump-starting the car is the electrolysis of water producing oxygen and hydrogen, which can cause battery explosions. The approximate redox reaction behind this battery is given below:
\begin{center}\ce{	Pb_{(s)} + PbO2_{(s)} + 2H^+_{(aq)} + 2HSO4^-_{(aq)} ->[2e^-] 2PbSO4_{(s)} + 2H2O_{(l)}	}\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=$2V\end{center}

One of the drawbacks of the lab battery is its weight and the fact that contains a corrosive liquid that can leak. Dry cells are a type of battery that does not contain any liquid solution, invented more than 100 years ago. They can be found in two versions, the acid version, and the alkaline or basic version which indeed last longer. The acidic dry cell with giving an estimate of 1.5V is made of a zinc inner case acting as anode and a carbon rod in contact with a moistened mixture of \ce{MnO2} and \ce{NH4Cl} acting as a cathode. 

\begin{center}\ce{	Zn + 2NH4^+ + 2MnO2   ->[2e^-] Zn^{2+} + Mn2O3 + 2NH3 + 2H2O	}\end{center}


The alkali version used \ce{KOH} or \ce{NaOH} to replace \ce{NH4Cl}. 
\begin{center}\ce{	Zn + 2OH^- + 2MnO2 + H2O   ->[2e^-] ZnO + H2O + Mn2O3 + 2OH^-	}\end{center}

The zinc anode corrodes less rapidly in basic--alkaline--conditions.
Other dry cells are the silver cell, the mercury cell, and the rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery. The silver cell is made of Zn anode and \ce{Ag2O} under basic conditions as a cathode. Mercury cells are made of a Zn anode and \ce{HgO} in a basic environment as the cathode. The Ni-Cd batteries are made of a Cd anode and a \ce{NiO2} cathode.The approximate redox reaction behind this battery is given below:
\begin{center}\ce{	Cd_{(s)} + NiO2_{(s)} + 2OH^-_{(aq)} + 2H2O_{(aq)} ->[2e^-] Cd(OH)2_{(s)} + Ni(OH)2_{(s)} + 2OH^-_{(s)}	}\end{center}
A remarkable type of battery is the lithium-ion batteries used in rechargeable cellphones and laptops. One of the first designs contained \ce{LiCoO2} dopped with numerous transition metals and \ce{LiC6}. When the battery is used--on discharge--Lithium ions (\ce{Li+}) migrate from the anode to the cathode where they intercalate in the solid electrode, whereas electrons circulate to the anode in the external circuit. The opposite process happens during the charge.
Fuel cells are a special type of battery in which reactants are continuously supplied in the form of a gas. In hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen is being reduced in the anode to produce water and oxygen is being oxidized in the cathode.
