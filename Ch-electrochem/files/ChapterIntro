\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}B}{atteries} are portable power devices, essential in our every day life. They power cellphones and even cars. Batteries use the principles of chemistry to produce electricity. Galvanic cells are textbook batteries, not intended to generate electricity as they function reversibly and in equilibrium. 
In the eighteenth century, Luigi Galvani discovered that animals' muscles--in particular dead frogs--could be artificially moved by touching the muscles with rods of different metals. The generated electricity at first was believed to come from the muscles. However, Alessandro Volta proved that the source of electricity in muscle movement was indeed the metals. Volta created the first Voltaic pile by stacking metallic silver and zinc disks separated by paper soaked in saltwater. This early discovery jumpstarted electrochemistry, a new field of chemistry.
Indeed, chemical reactions can produce electricity, and electricity can drive chemical reactions.
