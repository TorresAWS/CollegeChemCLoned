We can use the standard reduction potentials table to compare the reducing character of two redox pairs. For example, if we compare the pairs \ce{Fe}/\ce{Fe^{2+}} and \ce{Zn}/\ce{Zn^{2+}}. We have that the reduction potentials are:
\begin{center}\ce{	Fe^{3+} + 3   e^-	 <=>	Fe_{(s)} }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1}=-$0.04V\\
\ce{Zn^{2+} + 2   e^-	 <=>	Zn_{(s)}  }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}=-$0.762V\end{center} 
We have that the smaller $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$ the stronger the reducing character. Hence, the pair \ce{Zn}/\ce{Zn^{2+}} is more reducing than \ce{Fe}/\ce{Fe^{2+}}. We can also compare the oxidizing character of two redox pairs. For example, if we compare the pairs \ce{O2}/\ce{H2O} and \ce{Ag^+}/\ce{Ag}. We have that the reduction potentials are:
\begin{center}\ce{	O2_{(g)} + 4H+ + 4e^-	 <=>	2H2O }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{1}=+$1.23V\\
\ce{Ag+ +e^-	 <=>	Ag_{(s)}	  }\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}_{2}=+$0.802V\end{center} 
We have that the larger $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$ the stronger the oxidizing character. Hence, the pair \ce{O2}/\ce{H2O} is more oxidizing than \ce{Ag^+}/\ce{Ag}.
