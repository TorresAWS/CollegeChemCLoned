Cell potentials are electrochemistry functions that inform about the voltage generated by a galvanic cell. Gibbs free energies are thermodynamic functions that inform about the maximum work--in particular non-expansion- work--that one can extract from a system, under constant pressure and temperature. Both properties are related. At the same time, the equilibrium constant of a system is related to the Gibbs free energy change. Hence, these three properties are indeed related: the cell potential, the Gibbs free energy, and the equilibrium constant.
