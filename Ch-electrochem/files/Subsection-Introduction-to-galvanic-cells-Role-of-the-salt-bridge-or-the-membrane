The role of the salt bridge or the porous membrane is to compensate for the excess of ions generated in each electrode hence closing the electric circuit. Salt bridges contain saturated solutions of electrolytes containing ions with similar ionic mobility (\ce{KCl} or \ce{NH4NO3}). These electrolytes are also non-reactive with the chemicals involved in the galvanic cell. Each side of the salt bridge or membrane becomes charged due to ionic accumulation, with negative ions accumulating near the cathode and positive charges near the anode. Porous membranes impact the galvanic cell potential with an extra contribution called the liquid junction voltage. This voltage is due to the ion accumulation on both sides of the membrane. When using a salt bridge, the liquid junction voltage on the left side of the bridge compensates the salt bridge on the right side of the bridge so that overall the galvanic cell potential remains unaffected by the bridge.
