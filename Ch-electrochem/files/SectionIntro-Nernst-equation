A galvanic cell connected to a potentiometer works at equilibrium. That means that neither reactants are being consumed nor products are being formed. In working conditions, as a real battery produces electricity reactants are consumed and products are formed. As the galvanic cell works, the concentration of the species inside the cell change and cell potential is certainly affected by that. Standard conditions do not hold anymore as molarities are different than 1M. The Nernst equation--the name honors Walther Nerns, a german electrochemist--gives the dependence of the cell potential with the molarity of the species involved in the redox reaction happening at the cell.
