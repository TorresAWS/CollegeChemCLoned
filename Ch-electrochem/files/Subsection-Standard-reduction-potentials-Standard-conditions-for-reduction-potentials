The potential of a single electrode cannot be accurately measured as electrodes only exist in the context of a two-electrode galvanic cell. Single electrode potentials are defined in a galvanic cell made of the electrode and a reference electrode with null potential under certain conditions. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is universally accepted as the reference electrode in electrochemistry, hence having null potential.  The hydrogen electrode contains gas hydrogen in contact with an acidic 1M HCl solution at 25$^{\circ}$C with a wire made of platinum--an inert metal--that mediates the electron transfer. Below you can find the reaction involved in the hydrogen electrode:
\begin{center} \ce{H2(\text{1 atm}) -> 2H_{(aq)}^{+}(\text{1 M}) + 2e^-}\hfill $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}=0$ \end{center}
The voltage of a galvanic cell made of an electrode combined with the reference hydrogen electrode will directly measure the electrode potential. Still, electrode potentials depend on concentration (or pressure for gases) and temperature conditions. The standard conditions for electrode potentials are a molar concentration of 1M for all electrolytes and pressure of 1atm. The electrode potential measured at these conditions is called standard potential $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$, where the symbol $^{\circ}$ represents standard state.
At the same time, every redox reaction can be written as a reduction--consuming electrons--or an oxidation reaction producing electrons. As we tabulate standard electrode potentials, all reactions will be written as reduction reactions and the standard potentials are called standard reduction potential $\mathcal{E}^{\circ}$.
