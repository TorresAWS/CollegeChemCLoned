    \begin{steps}
        \newstep[] Obtain a copper and zinc electrodes, a salt bridge as well as a potentiometer.
\newstep[] We use a BK Precision potentiometer: make sure the black wire is connected to the COM connnection whereas the red one is connected to the Hz V $\Omega$ connection. The potentiometer has to be turned towards the right ro start measuring DC. Make sure you select the scale that that gives Volts (labelled as 2 in the V scale).
    \newstep[] Place 0.1M \ce{Cu(NO3)2} (approximately 50 mL) in one compartment of the cell and 0.1M \ce{Zn(NO3)2} in the other.
    \newstep[] Obtain a copper and zinc electrodes.
            \newstep[] Clean the electrodes by dipping them (no more than 3 seconds) into 40mL of 6M \ce{HNO3}. You will notice that the surface of the electrodes will become bright. Rinse the electrodes with distilled water.
