\item What happens to the temperature of water while its boiling?
\vspace{2cm}

\item How many calories are needed to boil 100g of water? ($\text{heat}_{\text{vaporization}}$=540 cal/g )
\vspace{2cm}


\item How many calories are needed to melt 100g of ice? ($\text{heat}_{\text{fusion}}$=80 cal/g )
\vspace{2cm}


\item How many calories are needed to warm up 100g of water from 10 to 50$^\circ$C? ($\text{C}_{\text{e}}$=1 cal/g/$^\circ$C )
\vspace{5cm}

\item The following formula is used to calculate the heat of fusion of ice using a calorimeter, where  $C_{e, water}$ is the specific heat of water (1cal/g/$^\circ$C), the mass of ice is 5g, the mass of water in the calorimeter is 100g and the temperature decrease is -4$^\circ$C
\begin{equation*}
-m_{ice}\times Q_{fusion}+m_{water}\times C_{e, water}\times \Delta T=0
\end{equation*}
Calculate the  heat of fusion of ice.
