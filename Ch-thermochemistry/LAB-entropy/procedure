        \newstep[] Obtain a coffee cup calorimeter with a thermometer and a plastic lid.
    \newstep[] Weight  about 8.5g of \ce{NaNO3}. Write down the mass you weighed in the results section.
    \newstep[] Use a 100mL graduated cylinder to add 100mL of distilled water in the calorimeter.
    \newstep[] Measure the temperature of water in the calorimeter.  Record this temperatures as your initial temperature $t_i$.
	\newstep[] Get the timer ready. Time should be taken as soon as the solid reactant is added.
    \newstep[] Add the \ce{NaNO3} to the calorimeter. If you are using a magnetic stirrer set the speed to a medium speed and make sure the heating option is off. Then add the solid. Start the timer immediately and place the lid on the calorimeter.
	\newstep[] Record the temperature for 4 min. Do not stop the timer during the experiment. Record the results in the results table.
	
	\newstep[]  Replicate the experiment one more time.
    \newstep[] Plot the temperature of the calorimeter against time and use a straight line to extrapolate your results against the starting time (time = 0 s). Plot the results for both replicates in the same plot. Record the extrapolated temperature as $t_f$.
    \newstep[] Do not carry out any calculation before finishing the plot from the previous step. Calculate the change of enthalpy, $\Delta H$.
    \newstep[] Calculate the average enthalpy change using the two replicated experiments.
    \newstep[] If your instructor assigns you an unknown solute, repeat the previous procedure with this new solute.

\section*{Calculations}
\mycircled{1} This is the initial temperature before you add the solid.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{2} This is the final temperature after the dissolution reaction stops. You need to plot the data and extrapolate to get this value.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{3} This is the maximum temperature during the experiment. Comparing the initial and final temperatures you can figure out of the reaction is endothermic or exothermic.
\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{4} This is the mass of salt weighed. \vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{5} This is the number of moles of salt: \[\mycircled{4}  \;\; / \;\; 84.9947 \]
\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{6} You can calculate the enthalpy change ($\Delta H$ in KJ/mol) by means of the following formula:
    \[\Delta H= -\frac{1\times 10^{-3}}{\;\;\mycircled{5}\;\;}\cdot \big( 4.184 \cdot 1.0 \cdot 100.0 \cdot (\;\;\mycircled{2}\;\;-\;\;\mycircled{1}\;\;)+10 \cdot (\;\;\mycircled{2}\;\;-\;\;\mycircled{1}\;\;)\big)\]
 \vspace{0.5cm}\\
 \mycircled{7} This is the average enthalpy.
 \vspace{0.5cm}\\
  \mycircled{8} This is the average maximum temperature.
 \vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{9} Calculate the minimum entropy change for equilibrium using the maximum temperature and the average enthalpy (remember enthalpy is expressed in KJ/mol and entropy in J/molK)\vspace{0.5cm}\\
    \[\Delta S_{min}= \frac{\Delta H}{T_{m}}=\frac{\;\;\mycircled{7}\;\;\times 1000}{\;\;\mycircled{8}\;\;} \]
