\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}E}{nergy} involves many aspects of our everyday life. Chemical reactions happening in our body consume or release energy as we walk, study, and even breath. We also use energy at home to warm food or turn on the lights, to drive our cars and go to work. The energy needed for our body to function comes from food. If we do not eat for a while, we run low on energy. Similarly, the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, propane, or gasoline provides enough energy to maintain our homes.  On the other hand, how do we measure the energy released or consumed in a chemical process? This chapter will answer this and other questions as it covers different aspects of the interplay between chemistry and energy. You will learn about temperature, heat, and how an energy exchange implies changes on temperature.
