In this chapter we will analyze energy changes associated with chemical reactions. In order to do this, we need to define the system and its surroundings. The system will be the chemical reaction often happening in a beaker, whereas the surroundings would be the area surrounding the beaker. The system plus its surroundings is called the universe. The beaker may lose energy, and in that case energy will flow from the system to the surroundings. Similarly, the system may gain energy, flowing from the surroundings to the beaker.
In a closed system, the energy is being conserved and when one type of energy disappears, a different type of energy will appear. As an example, if you drop an object from the top of a building, originally the object had potential energy that converts into kinetic energy as the object gains speed. This is called the law of conservation of energy.
