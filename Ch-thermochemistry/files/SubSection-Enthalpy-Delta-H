 
Consider the following two reactions:
\begin{center}\ce{ N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} -> 2NO_{(g)} } \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H^{\circ}_f=181KJ$\end{center}
\begin{center}\ce{ Fe2O3_{(s)} +  3CO_{(g)} -> 2Fe_{(s)} + 3CO2_{(g)} } \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H^{\circ}_R=-25KJ$\end{center}
The first example represents a formation reaction and thus the enthalpy is labeled as $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$. In contrast, the second reaction is not a formation reaction. This is because the reactants are not elements in their natural state: \ce{CO_{(g)}} and \ce{Fe2O3_{(s)}} have enthalpies different than zero. For this reason, the second enthalpy is labeled as $\Delta H^{\circ}_R$ and is called the standard enthalpy of the reaction.
%\item[\docfilehook{How to indicate $\Delta H^{\circ}_R$ in a reaction }{How to indicate $\Delta H^{\circ}_R$ in a reaction}]
%Normally in chemical reaction the value of $\Delta H^{\circ}_R$ can be written in two different ways. You can see the enthalpy added in the reaction as a reactant or product or you can find the enthalpy written on the right side of the reaction. For example, in the first example above--the endothermic reaction--you can write:
%\ce{ N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} -> 2NO_{(g)} + 181KJ} 
%or you can find:
%\ce{ N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} -> 2NO_{(g)} } \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H^{\circ}_R=181KJ$.
%For the second example above, the exothermic reaction, you can indicate the enthalpy like:
%\ce{ 2NO_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} + 114KJ -> 2NO2_{(g)}} 
%or you can find:
%\begin{center}\ce{ N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} -> 2NO_{(g)} } \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H^{\circ}_R=-114KJ$.\end{center}
%Note that in an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy value is indicated as a product as the reaction produces heat, whereas in an endothermic reaction, it is indicated as a reactant, as these reactions consume heat.
