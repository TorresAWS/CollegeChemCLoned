You want to think about enthalpy as heat. There are different ways to measure the heat exchanged in a system--as constant-pressure heat or constant-volume heat. Enthalpy, is the constant-pressure heat. It is important in chemistry, as many chemical reactions happen at constant pressure, that is, in open containers in contact with the atmosphere. Enthalpy, is indeed related to the internal energy
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
H=U+PV 
\end{split}\end{equation*}
Working at constant pressure we have
  \begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\Delta H=\Delta U+P\Delta V 
\end{split}\end{equation*}
as $\Delta U =Q-P\Delta V$ we have
  \begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\Delta H= Q_{p} 
\end{split}\end{equation*}
where $Q_{p} $ means heat measured at constant pressure.
