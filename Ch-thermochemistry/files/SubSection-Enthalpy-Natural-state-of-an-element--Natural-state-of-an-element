The natural state of an element is the most stable state in which we find this element in nature. For example, you can find Aluminum as a solid, liquid, or gas. However, its natural state is solid, as we find Al in nature as a solid. That is the reason why $\Delta H_f^{\circ}(\ce{Al_{(g)}})=314$KJ/mol, whereas $\Delta H_f^{\circ}(\ce{Al_{(s)}})=0$KJ/mol. In general, metals, in their natural state is solid. For non-metallic elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, and chlorine, its natural state is in the form of a diatomic gas molecule. For example, $\Delta H_f^{\circ}(\ce{H2_{(g)}})=0$KJ/mol, $\Delta H_f^{\circ}(\ce{N2_{(g)}})=0$KJ/mol or $\Delta H_f^{\circ}(\ce{O2_{(g)}})=0$KJ/mol. For the case of carbon, its natural state is graphite, $\Delta H_f^{\circ}(\ce{C_{graphite}_{(s)}})=0$KJ/mol. Molecules such as \ce{H2O} or \ce{NO} have standard enthalpy different than zero. Mind that molecules are not elements, and hence are made of different elements.
Table \ref{tab:Table-Standard-states} lists the standard state of common elements.
