Think about what happens to a car's engine. In an engine, chemical energy is converted into movement and with this movement, a car can carry work. Work ($W$) is force ($F$) applied over a distance ($\Delta h$):
\begin{equation*}
    W = F\cdot \Delta h    = (P\cdot A) \cdot \Delta h
\end{equation*}
For the case of a gas confined in a cylindrical container, force is related to pressure times area ($A$). Therefore, if the pressure is constant as $A\cdot \Delta h$ equals to volume ($V$), we have that
\begin{equation}
\boxed{   W = -P\cdot \Delta V   }
\label{formula2:92}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item W represents work
\item P is the pressure 
 \item $\Delta V$ is the change of volume calculated as $V_{final}-V_{initial}$
\end{where}

The minus sign is just a convention, as in chemistry the work done by the surroundings to a system is considered positive, as the system gains work (energy). Therefore, when $\Delta V$ is negative because the system receives work, the value of $W$ has to be positive. In another word, the sign convention for work is:
\begin{solutionbox}
\[ W > 0 \; \text{the system receives work}\qquad and \qquad W < 0 \; \text{the system gives away work}\]
\end{solutionbox}
As a final note, the type of work that involves a change in volume at constant pressure is normally called PV work.
