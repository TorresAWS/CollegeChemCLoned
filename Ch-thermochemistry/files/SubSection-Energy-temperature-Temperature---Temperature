Temperature indicates how hot or cold a substance is compared to another substance. Heat always flows from a substance with a higher temperature to a substance with a lower temperature until the temperatures of both are the same. When you drink hot coffee or touch a hot pan, heat flows to your mouth or hand, which is at a lower temperature. When you touch an ice cube, it feels cold because heat flows from your hand to the colder ice cube. Three units of temperature often employed are celsius ($^{\circ}$C, $\text{T}_C$), Fahrenheit ($^{\circ}$F, $\text{T}_F$) or Kelvin (K, $\text{T}_K$). If you need to convert temperature units from Fahrenheit  to celsius or from celsius to Fahrenheit you need to use the formulas below:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{   T_F = 1.8T_C  + 32   }
\qquad
\boxed{      T_F = 1.8T_K  -459.4   }
\qquad
\boxed{     T_K = T_C  + 273   }
\label{formula2:2}
\end{equation}
