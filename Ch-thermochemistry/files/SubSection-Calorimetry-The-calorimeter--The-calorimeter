A calorimeter is device used to measure the energy exchanged in a chemical reaction--we call this molar heat of reaction, $\Delta Q_{r}$. In essence, a calorimeter is a closed system that does not let the heat come though its walls. By measuring the temperature change inside the calorimeter we can compute the energy exchange in a chemical reaction happening inside the calorimeter. If the temperature inside a calorimeter increases, this means that the reaction releases energy. In the contrary, if the temperature inside a calorimeter decreases, this means that the reaction consumes energy. There are two different types of calorimeters: constant-pressure and constant-volume calorimeters. As a note, $\Delta Q_{r}$ is called molar heat of reaction as it represents energy per mole, with units of kJ/mol.
