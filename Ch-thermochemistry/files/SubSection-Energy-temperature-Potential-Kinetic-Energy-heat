Energy can be classified as potential energy or kinetic energy. 
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and any fast-moving object has kinetic energy. Think about a bullet coming out of a gun; as the bullet moves very fast it contains kinetic energy that can be releases when it collide with a target. Potential energy is energy stored in objects located at a certain height. A boulder resting on top of a mountain has potential energy because of its location. If the boulder rolls down the mountain, the potential energy becomes kinetic energy. Water stored in a reservoir has potential energy. When the water goes over the dam, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy resulting from the interaction of charged particles is called electrostatic energy. Heat refers to thermal energy, which is associated with the random motion of particles in a substance and therefore is related to kinetic energy. A frozen pizza feels cold because the particles in the pizza are moving slowly. As the pizza receives heat, the motion of the particles increase. Eventually the particles have enough energy to make the pizza hot and ready to be eaten. When a substance receives heat it gets warmer and it raises its temperature, whereas if it looses heat it gets cooler and its temperature decreases.
