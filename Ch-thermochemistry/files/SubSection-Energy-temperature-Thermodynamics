Thermochemistry is a subject of a broader field called thermodynamics, which studies the interconversion of energy (heat and other types) and mass. Thermodynamics study systems, like chemical reactions. The term system, refers to the part of the universe being study. Systems can be classified as: open, closed and isolated systems. An open system can exchange mass and energy with its surroundings, whereas a closed system can only exchange mass and not energy. Isolated systems cannot exchange neither mass nor energy with its surroundings.
The state of a system is characterized by the values of its volume, pressure, temperature, energy and composition, so that of a system receives heat it will change its state. Energy, volume, pressure and temperature are called state functions--or state properties--, as these properties are determined by the state of the system, independently of the path used to reach that state. In another words, these properties are path-independent. For example, in a building, the floor location of a person would be a state function, as it would not matter the path the person took to reach that state. In contrast the amount of effort to make it to a specific floor will not be a state function, as it changes depending on the path used.
