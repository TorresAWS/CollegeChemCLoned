The values of enthalpies are tabulated at the end of the chapter. The term standard refers to standard pressure conditions (1 atm) and is indicates by a degree sign on the top right side ($\Delta H^{\circ}$). Let us see how to use this table. If you look for the standard enthalpy of C--an element--from the table you might find several values. The values of graphite carbon is $\Delta H_f^{\circ}=0$KJ/mol. Differently, the values for diamond carbon is different than zero, being $\Delta H_f^{\circ}=1.0$KJ/mol. Similarly, the value for gas carbon is not zero also, being $\Delta H_f^{\circ}=716.67$KJ/mol. This is because the nature state of carbon is in the form of graphite. That is, the most common way in which we find carbon in nature is in the form of graphite and not diamond or gas. Let us find the standard enthalpy for molecular nitrogen, \ce{N2(g)}--another element. If you look into the table you will find a value of $\Delta H_f^{\circ}=0$KJ/mol, again because the natural state of nitrogen is in the form of gas \ce{N2}. How much is the standard enthalpy of gas hydrogen, \ce{H2}? If you look in the table, the value is also $\Delta H_f^{\circ}=0$KJ/mol. The rule of thumb is: elements on its natural state have zero $H_f^{\circ}$. Below we will explain more about the meaning of natural state.
Now, look for the standard enthalpy of carbon monoxide gas, \ce{CO(g)}. The value should not be zero, as carbon dioxide is not an element and is made of two different types of atoms. Indeed, in the table we find $\Delta H_f^{\circ}(\ce{CO_{(g)}})=-110.5$KJ/mol.
