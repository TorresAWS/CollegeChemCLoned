Materials can absorb heat and receive work. On one hand, think about a pizza in your oven, or a cup of milk in the microwave. These substances receive heat from the oven or in form of microwaves and they become hot. Heat transforms in an increase of temperature. 
On the other hand, if you hammer a wall, the wall receives work from you and this work is translated to energy as the wall may break. Work and heat are both combined in a property called internal energy, $E$.
Heat transform in a temperature change. Some substances like metals are able to increase its temperature very quickly with a small amount of heat received, whereas others need a larger amount of heat to rise up its temperature. Think about why you use oil to deep fry food? Why not use water? First of all, oil can raise its temperature very quickly and on top of that it does not boil easily.
