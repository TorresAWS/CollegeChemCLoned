When you are running, walking, dancing, or thinking, you are using energy to do work. In fact, energy is defined as the ability to do work. Suppose you are climbing a steep hill. Perhaps you become too tired to go on; you do not have sufficient energy to do any more work. Now suppose you sit down and have lunch. In a while you will have obtained energy from the food, and you will be able to do more work and complete the climb. Similarly, chemical energy is the energy stored in the structure of chemicals and it depends on the arrangement of molecules and the nature of these molecules.
