Materials can absorb heat and receive work. On one hand, think about a pizza in your oven, or a cup of milk in the microwave. These substances receive heat from the oven or in form of microwaves and they become hot. Heat transforms in an increase in temperature. 
On the other hand, if you hammer a wall, the wall receives work from you, and this work is translated to energy as the wall may break. Work and heat are both combined in a property called internal energy, $E$.
