In the previous section we relied on a table el standard enthalpies of formation in order to compute enthalpy changes in general reaction. This enthalpy change $\Delta H_R^{\circ}$ is related to the heat exchanged in the reaction. In this section we will not use the tables of enthalpy anymore. Imagine you do not have access to this table. And we will find alternative ways to predict $\Delta H_f^{\circ}$ given a series of reactions with know enthalpies. In short you will have to identify the enthalpies that are zero--the enthalpies corresponding to an element on its natural state-- and set up an equation that helps you find out the missing enthalpy.
