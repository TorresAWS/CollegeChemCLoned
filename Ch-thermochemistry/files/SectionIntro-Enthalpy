In the last section we have seen that when a chemical reaction proceeds it exchanges energy with the surroundings. This energy can be measured in many different conditions. When it is measured at constant pressure--these are regular conditions in chemistry, think about a reaction happening at a beaker--this energy change has a different name: it is called enthalpy and is represented with the symbol $\Delta H_f^{\circ}$. In this section we will cover the different types of enthalpies depending on the type of reaction--formation or reaction--and we will find out how to compute the enthalpy change for a reaction using tables of standard enthalpies given at the end of the chapter.
