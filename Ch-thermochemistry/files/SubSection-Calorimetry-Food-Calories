How much food do you eat? How many calories do you ingest a day? When you are watching your food intake, the Calories you are counting are kilocalories (1000cal, Kcal, or Cal). In the field of nutrition, it is common to use the Calorie, Cal (with an uppercase C) to indicate 1000 cal or 1 kcal. 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{   1Cal=1000 cal } \qquad\text{or}\qquad  \boxed{\frac{1Cal}{1000 cal}}\qquad\text{or}\qquad  \boxed{\frac{1000 cal}{1 Cal}}
\label{formula2:4}
\end{equation}
