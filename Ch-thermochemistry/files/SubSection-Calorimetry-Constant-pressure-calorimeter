A constant-pressure calorimeter is the simplest of all calorimeters and is called constant pressure as the pressure inside the calorimeter is constant and equal to the atmospheric pressure. A constant-pressure calorimeter is just a double coffee cup covered with a lit. Inside this cup, a chemical reaction occurs in a liquid phase. If the reaction produces any gases as the cup is just covered with a lit, the pressure will always be equal to the atmospheric pressure as the gas can escape through the lit. The formula used in calorimetry with a constant-pressure calorimeter has only two terms. Let us use a reaction that produced heat as an example. Inside a constant-pressure calorimeter, you introduced two reagents, and a reaction happens, producing heat. The heat exchanged from the reaction (first term) changes the temperature of the liquid inside the calorimeter (second term). At the same time, we assume that the walls of the calorimeter do not absorb heat. The formula used in calorimetry with a constant-pressure calorimeter is the following: 
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
 0=n\cdot\Delta Q_{r}+\Delta Q_{water}  \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{constant pressure}}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $n\cdot\Delta Q_{r}$   is the heat exchanged due to a chemical reaction
\item $\Delta Q_{water}$    is the heat received or released by water 
\end{where}
The water contribution is given by the heat formula given above. After we plug the formula of the heat into the formula above we arrive at the constant-pressure calorimetry formula:%\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1}{Add this formula to your flashcard.}
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\boxed{  0=n\cdot\Delta Q_{r}+V\cdot d\cdot  c_{e}^{\ce{sol}}\cdot  (T_{f}-T_{i})      } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{constant pressure}}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\Delta Q_{r}$   is the heat exchanged due to a chemical reaction in $J/mol$
  \item $n$   is the number of moles of the limiting reagent 
\item $V$ is the volume of water in mL contained in the calorimeter 
\item $d$ is the density of the solution in g/mL 
 \item $c_{e}^{\ce{sol}}$  is the specific heat of the solution: tend to be similar to water, $4.184 \text{J}/\text{g}^{\circ}\text{C}$
\item $T_{f}-T_{i}=\Delta T$, is the temperature change from the initial to the final temperature
\end{where}
