Some reactions  these are called 
Exothermic reactions release heat, where as endothermic reactions absorb heat. Think for example the combustion of the gas in a cooking stove. This reaction produces heat and hence it is exothermic. Differently, bread needs heat to rise. Hence, the chemical reaction involved in bread making should be endothermic. 
Similarly, when melting an ice cube you need to give energy to the cube so that it becomes water. 
The melting of ice is an endothermic reaction. Endothermic reactions have positive heat of reaction $\Delta H_{R}$ . In this text, heat exchange will be represented by an indication of heat before or after the arrow. \
Hence, endthermic reactions--reaction with positive $\Delta H_{R}$--will be accompanied by an expression of heat in the products side .
\begin{center}\ce{ Reactants +} \textcolor{red}{\faFire} \ce{  -> Products } \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H_{R}> 0$   \end{center}
Differently, exothermic reactions--reaction with negative $\Delta H_{R}$--will be accompanied by an expression of heat in the products side have negative $\Delta H_{R}$.
\begin{center}\ce{ Reactants   -> Products +}   \textcolor{red}{\faFire} \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H_{R}< 0$\end{center}
Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-EndoExo} represents endo and exothermic processes.
