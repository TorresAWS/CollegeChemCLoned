Some reactions release heat and are called exothermic. Others absorb heat and are called endothermic. Think for example the combustion of the gas in a cooking stove, it produces heat and hence the chemical reaction happening is exothermic. Differently, if you cook bread, it needs heat to rise. Similarly, if you melt an ice cube you need to give energy to the cube so that it becomes water. These are examples of endothermic reactions. Endothermic reactions have positive  $\Delta Q_{r}$ whereas exothermic reactions have negative $\Delta Q_{r}$.
