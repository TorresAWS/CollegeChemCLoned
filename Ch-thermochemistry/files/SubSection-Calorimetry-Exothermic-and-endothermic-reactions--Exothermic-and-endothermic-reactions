Some reactions called exothermic reactions release heat. Others absorb heat and are called endothermic reactions. Think for example the combustion of the gas in a cooking stove. This reaction produces heat and hence it is exothermic. Differently, bread needs heat to rise. Hence, the chemical reaction involved in bread making should be endothermic. Similarly, if you melt an ice cube you need to give energy to the cube so that it becomes water. The melting of ice is an endothermic reaction. Endothermic reactions have positive heat of reaction $\Delta Q_{r}$ and are normally accompanied by an indication of heat in the reactants side of the reaction before the arrow.

Differently, exothermic reactions normally accompanied by an expression of heat in the products sides have negative $\Delta Q_{r}$.
\begin{center}\ce{ Reactants   -> Products +}   \textcolor{red}{\faFire} \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta Q_{r}< 0$\end{center}
