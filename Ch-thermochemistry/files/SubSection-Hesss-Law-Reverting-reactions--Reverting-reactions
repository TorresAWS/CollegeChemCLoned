Imagine they give you the following reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{ N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} -> 2NO_{(g)} } \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H^{\circ}_1=-114KJ$\end{center}
and you need to calculate the enthalpy change for this other reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{2NO_{(g)}   -> N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} } \hspace*{0pt}\hfill $\Delta H^{\circ}_2$\end{center}
If you compare both reactions you will see the second reaction equals the first reaction but reverted. If you revert a reaction, the enthalpy change changes sign. Therefore, $\Delta H^{\circ}_2=114KJ$.
