A calorimeter is a tool used to measure the exchange of heat happening in chemical reactions and calorimetry is the science that measures heat exchange by using calorimeters. There are tow types of calorimeters, very fancy and expensive ones called constant-volume calorimeters and more affordable ones, in the form of a coffee cup, called constant-pressure calorimeters. This section will show you how to carry calorimetric calculations.
