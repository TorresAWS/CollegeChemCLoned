Heat transforms in a temperature change. Some substances like metals can increase their temperature very quickly with a small amount of heat received, whereas others need a larger amount of heat to rise their temperature. Think about why you use oil to deep fry food. Why not use water? First of all, oil can raise its temperature very quickly and on top of that it does not boil easily.
