\vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 1. Specific heat of a metal}
The goal of this mini experiment is to calculate the specific heat of an unknown metal. You will do this by warming up the metal in a hot water bath and by using a calorimeter to cool down the metal.
\begin{steps}
    \newstep[] Obtain a metallic object. Record its mass. 
    \newstep[] Place a 250mL beaker (or a 400mL) on top of a hot plate. Place a thermometer in the beaker so that it does not touch the walls of the beaker and secure it with a clam. Start warming up the water at high heat so that the water boils. Add some boiling chips.
    \newstep[] Tie a string to the object and submerge it in the how bath. Let it there for 10 min.
    \newstep[] Obtain a double styrofoam cup and weight it. Record its mass.
    \newstep[] Add 50mL of water to the cup and weight again. Record the new mass. Make sure the water is enough to fully cover the metal. If not add some more.
    \newstep[] Measure the temperature of the hot bath after the metals it's been there for 10 min. Record the value.
    \newstep[] Using the string and being careful not to drop the object, transfer the metal object from the hot bath to the cup with water. Cover the cup quickly and stir.
    \newstep[] Using the thermometer in the calorimeter, measure the highest temperature reached by the water in the cup after you drop the object.
    \newstep[] You might have to replicate the experiment.

 \vspace{0.2cm}{\large \bfseries 2. Food value in food}
The goal of this mini experiment is to calculate the number of Calories, or Kcal, in different food products using the energy values of different food ingredients--carbs, fats and protein.
\begin{steps}
    \newstep[] Obtain a food product labels.
        \newstep[]  Write down the name of the product in the table below.
        \newstep[]  Write down the mass of a serving in the table below.
        \newstep[]  List the grams of carbohydrates, fats and protein in your product.
                \newstep[]  calculate the number of Calories (kcal) for each food type in a serving. The accepted energy values of carbohydrates, fats and proteins are 4, 9 and 4 Cal/g.
                \newstep[] Calculate the total number of calories in a serving and compare the value with the one in the food label. 
\end{steps}
