We mix 2.5mL of \ce{NaOH} 0.5M with 2.5mL of \ce{HCl} 0.5M both at 25$^{\circ}$C in a constant-pressure calorimeter. The heat of reaction is -40KJ/mol. Calculate the final temperature inside the calorimeter, if the solution density is 1g/mL and the specific heat of the solution is 4.184$\text{J}/g^{\circ}\text{C}$.
