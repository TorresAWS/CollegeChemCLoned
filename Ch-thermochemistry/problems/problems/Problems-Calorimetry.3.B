We mix 50mL of 2M HCl with 50mL of 2M NaOH in a coffee-cup calorimeter. Both solutions are initially at 40$^{\circ}$C. Calculate the final temperature of the solution in the calorimeter considering that the specific heat of the mixture is 4.184$\frac{J}{g^{\circ}C}$ and the density of the solution is 1g/mL. The molar heat of the reaction is -100kJ/mol.
