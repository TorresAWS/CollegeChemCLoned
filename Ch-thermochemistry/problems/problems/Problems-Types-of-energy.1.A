Discuss the changes in potential and kinetic energy in the following scenarios:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]	
\item When water falls down a waterfall % potential energy converts into kinetic while water falls down
 \item  When a person throughs away an object high up in the air % kinetic energy converts into potential energy
\end{inparaenum}
