\begin{question}[ID=\the\value{numA}]\SetQuestionProperties{section-title=\nameref{sec:units}}
A sample of gas expands from 3 to 4 L at constant pressure. Using $1L\cdot atm=101.3J$, calculate the work done in J under the following conditions:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]	
\item The gas expands against the vacuum. 
\item The gas expands against a constant pressure of 5atm 
\end{inparaenum} 
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]	
\item 0
\item	 -506J 
\end{inparaenum}
