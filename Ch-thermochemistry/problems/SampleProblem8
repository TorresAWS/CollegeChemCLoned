We have all data needed to solve the calorimetry formula. We have the moles of chemical inside the calorimeter, the heat capacity of the calorimeter, the initial and final temperature of water, and the amount of water. Mind that the specific heat of water is always given and you need to remember the value. Also and more importantly mind that the units of the heat capacity of the calorimeter are $K\text{J}/^{\circ}\text{C}$, whereas the units of the specific heat of water are $\text{J}/\text{g}^{\circ}\text{C}$ and hence, we need to convert $KJ$ into $J$; that is the reason we use $10000 \text{J}/^{\circ}\text{C}$ as the heat capacity of the calorimeter. Plugging all values into the calorimetry formula we have:\\
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
0=3mol\cdot\Delta Q_{r}+10g\cdot 4.184 \text{J}/\text{g}^{\circ}\text{C}\cdot  (40^{\circ}C-25^{\circ}C)  \\
+10000 \text{J}/^{\circ}\text{C}\cdot  (40^{\circ}C-25^{\circ}C) \end{split}\end{equation*}
Solving for $\Delta Q_{r}$ we obtain $-50209J/mol$ that is the same as $-50.209KJ/mol$. As the value is negative, it means that the reaction produced energy and hence is exothermic.
