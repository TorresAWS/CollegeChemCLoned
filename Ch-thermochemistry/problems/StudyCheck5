When a hot balloon deflates, it receives $10^7$J of work from the external atmosphere and its temperature change from 90$^{\circ}$C to 25$^{\circ}$C. Given that the air initially contained in the balloon has a mass of $3\times 10^5$g and a specific heat of 1$\text{J}/\text{g}^{\circ}\text{C}$. Calculate the internal energy of the hot ballon.
