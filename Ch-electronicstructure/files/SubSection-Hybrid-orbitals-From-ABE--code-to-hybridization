In order to obtain the hybridization of an atomic center in a molecule we just need the \ce{ABE} code and Table \ref{tab:hybrid}. For example, if the code of a molecule is \ce{AB4}, the hybridization of the molecule will be $sp^3$. Similarly, if the class is \ce{AB3} the hybridization will be $sp^2$ and in this case an empty $p$ orbital will remain in the bond--mind there are three different $p$ orbitals: $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$. Another example, would be a molecule with class \ce{AB}. In this case, the hybridization will be $sp$ and two empty $p$ orbital will remain in the bond. A final example would be a molecule with class   \ce{AB4E}. This time, the hybridization would be $sp^3d^2$. Mind that in general the number of hybrid orbitals correspond to adding the $E$ and $B$ from the class. For example,  \ce{AB4E2}, we have two $E$ and four $B$ with a total of six orbitals, hence we will need a $s$ , three $p$'s and two $d$'s.
