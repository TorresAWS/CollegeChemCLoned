Molecules can either be polar or nonpolar. Polar molecules have a permanent dipole moment resulting from one of more polar bonds. Nonpolar molecules have no permanent dipole moment resulting either from nonpolar bonds or from a combination of polar bonds that lead to no dipole moment. The polarity of diatomic molecules, small molecules with only two atoms, only depends on the nature of the atoms that form the molecule. If the atoms in the molecule are the same (e.g. \ce{H2} or \ce{O2}) or have similar electronegativities, then the molecule would be nonpolar. If the atoms are different with electronegativity difference between 0.4 and 1.8 then the molecule would be polar. Examples are \ce{H2} a nonpolar molecule whereas \ce{HCl} or \ce{HBr} are both polar molecules.
