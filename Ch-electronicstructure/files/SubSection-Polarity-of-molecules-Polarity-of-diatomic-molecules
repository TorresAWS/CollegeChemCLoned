Molecules can either be polar or non-polar. The polarity of diatomic molecules only depends on the nature of the atoms that forms the molecule. If the atoms in the molecule are the same (e.g. \ce{H2} or \ce{O2}), then the molecule would be non-polar. If the atoms are different then the molecule would be polar. Examples are \ce{H2} a nonpolar molecule and \ce{HCl} or \ce{HBr}, both polar molecules. You can apply the same concept to a bond inside a molecule. The C-O bond in a \ce{CO2} molecule is a polar covalent bond, as C and O have different electronegativities.
