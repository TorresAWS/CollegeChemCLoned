Atoms gain or lose electrons when they combine to form molecules. This electron exchange is the driving force that drives the formation of molecules from single atoms. The octet rule claims that each atom in a molecule is normally surrounded by eight (octet) electrons. There are two important exceptions to this rule as \ce{H} is only surrounded by two electrons (this is called the duet rule), and \ce{B} by six.
