Atoms exchange electrons when they combine to form molecules. This electron exchange is the driving force that drives the formation of molecules from single atoms. The octet rule states that each atom in a stable molecule should be surrounded by eight (octet) electrons achieving noble gas electron configurations. There are two important exceptions to this rule as \ce{H} is surrounded only by two electrons (this is called the duet rule), and \ce{B} by six. This rule comes from the experimental observation of numerous molecules.
