The electrons of an atom are divided into core electrons and valence electrons. The valence electrons of an atom are involved in chemical bonds as they are less bonded to the nucleus. \emph{The number of valence electrons of an atom} corresponds to the group number. For example, hydrogen \ce{H} belongs to the group IA, and hence it has one valence electron. Similarly, oxygen \ce{O} belongs to the group VIA, having six valence electrons. Similarly, we can count the \emph{number of valence electrons of a molecule} by adding the valence electrons of the atoms that make the molecule. For example, water (\ce{H2O}) has eight valence electrons as each oxygen has one valence electron and oxygen has six. The number of \emph{pairs of electrons} is just the overall number of valence electrons divided by two. For example, water has eight valence electrons that correspond to 4 pairs of electrons.
