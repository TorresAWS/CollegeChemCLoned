The electrons of an atom can be divided in core electrons and valence electrons. The valence electrons of an atom are involved in chemical bonds as they are less bonded to the nucleus. The number of valence electrons in an atoms is the same as the group number. As an example, hydrogen \ce{H} belong to the group IA and hence has one valence electrons. Similarly, oxygen \ce{O} belongs to the group VIA and therefore it has six valence electrons.
