The number of covalent bonds that a nonmetal form is related to the number of electrons needed to complete the octet. For example, Hydrogen (1s$^2$) tends to form one bond to make compounds, whereas Nitrogen ([He]2s$^2$2p$^3$) forms three bonds. For example, in the \ce{NH3} molecule, each H forms one bond whereas N forms three bonds.
