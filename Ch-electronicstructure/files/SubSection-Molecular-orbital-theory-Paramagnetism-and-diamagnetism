One of the uses of the MO configuration is to predict the magnetic character (magnetic or non-magnetic) of a molecule. By reading the MO configuration of a molecule, we can also predict its magnetic character and hence estimate its magnetic properties. 
Paramagnetic molecules (normally referred to as magnetic) are attracted by magnetic fields, whereas diamagnetic molecules (normally referred to as non-magnetic) are repelled by magnetic fields. The magnetic character results from the presence of unpaired electrons in the MO configuration. For example: $\sigma^{2}_{2s}\sigma^{*1}_{2s}$ is a paramagnetic (magnetic) molecule as we have one unpaired electron in the $\sigma^{*}_{2s}$ orbital. In contrast, $\sigma^{2}_{2s}\sigma^{*2}_{2s}$ is a diamagnetic (non-magnetic) molecule, as it has no unpaired electrons.
