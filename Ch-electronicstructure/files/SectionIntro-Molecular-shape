Molecules consist of arrangements of atoms presented in different forms. Let us use as an example the \ce{H2O} molecule, which contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen. Knowing that both hydrogens are connected to oxygen by means of a covalent bond, one can envision several molecular geometries such as a linear geometry or maybe a v-shaped geometry with oxygen at the point. The geometry of a molecule determines its properties, and small geometrical changes can have severe consequences on the functioning of molecules. For example, at high temperatures, when proteins in the body denaturalize loosing their unique structure they also loose their functionality.
The goal of this section is to identify the approximate shape of a given molecule.
