Molecules are arrangements of atoms, and these arrangements can be presented in different form. Let us use as an example the \ce{H2O} molecule, which contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen. Knowing that both hydrogens are connected to oxygen by means of a covalent bond, one can envision several molecular geometries such as \hspace{.05in} \chemfig{ H-[:0]\lewis{26,O}-H}\hspace{.05in} or maybe \hspace{.05in}\chemfig{ H-[:45]\lewis{26,O}-[:315]H}\hspace{.05in}. The goal of this section is to identify the geometry of a given molecule. In order to do this, the electron-dot structure of the molecule are the key.
