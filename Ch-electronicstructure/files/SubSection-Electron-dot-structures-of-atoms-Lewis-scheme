The following steps can be used to obtain the Lewis structure of a general molecule:
\begin{solutionbox} \begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf}  Arrange the atoms in the molecule, in the form of a central atom and the surrounding atoms
 \item \begin{bf}Step two:\end{bf} Obtain the number of pairs of valence electrons by dividing the total number of valence electrons of the molecule by two
\item \begin{bf}Step three:\end{bf} Connect the surrounding atoms to the central atom with electron pairs
 \item \begin{bf}Step four:\end{bf} Place electron pairs on top of the surrounding atoms, always placing a maximum of four atoms
  \item \begin{bf}Step five:\end{bf} Place the remaining pairs in the central atom. 
 \item \begin{bf}Step six:\end{bf} Convert lone pairs of electrons into bonds in order to enforce the octet rule
 \item \begin{bf}Step seven:\end{bf} For extended octets place the extra electrons on the central atom
 \item \begin{bf}Step seight:\end{bf} When numerous equivalent Lewis structures exist, the best structures would have low formal charges, with negative charges located on electronegative atoms
  \end{enumerate} 
\end{solutionbox}
