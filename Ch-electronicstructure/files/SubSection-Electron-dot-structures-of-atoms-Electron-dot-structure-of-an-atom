In order to write the electron-dot structure of an atom, you just need to write down the symbol of the atom surrounded by the number of valence electrons one by one four directions, and if you have more than four electrons then add remaining electrons as pairs. For example, oxygen has six valence electrons and hence, the electron-dot structure would be \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4.6.,O}\hspace{.05in} Similarly, for the case of fluorine the  the electron-dot structure would be  \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4:6.,F} \hspace{.05in} In the case of an ion, you need to add (if its an anion) or substract (if its a cation) electrons, and for example the electron-dot structure of \ce{O^{2-}} is \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4:6:,O}\hspace{.05in}\ce{^{2-}}
