The electron-dot structure of an atom is a visual representation of the arrangement of the valence electrons of the atom. To write the electron-dot structure of an atom, you just need to write down the symbol of the atom surrounded by the valence electrons located in the four directions of the space: top, bottom, right, and left. To place the electrons, you start in any of the directions and fill one electron at a time. For example, for the case of three electrons we would have: \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0.2.4.,B} \hspace{.05in}. After all four directions have been filled, you need to start pairing the electrons. For example, for the case of five electrons, we would have: \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2.4.6.,P} \hspace{.05in}. Another example, oxygen has six valence electrons and hence, the electron-dot structure would be \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4.6.,O}\hspace{.05in} Similarly, the electron-dot structure of fluorine would be  \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4:6.,F} \hspace{.05in}. For ions, you need to add (if its an anion) or subtract (if its a cation) valence electrons, and for example the electron-dot structure of the oxide anion \ce{O^{2-}} is \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4:6:,O}\hspace{.05in}\ce{^{2-}}.
The electron-dot structure of atoms is useful to predict--or make sense--of the atomic valence. Mind that the number of valence electrons of an atom is not the same as the valence of the atom. The valence of an atom is a number used to combine with other atoms forming compounds. For example, the electron-dot structure of nitrogen is
\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2.4.6.,N} \hspace{.05in} and this atom needs to gain three electrons to reach the noble gas configuration with eight electrons\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4:6:,\ce{N}}\ce{^{3-}} \hspace{.05in} hence its valence is $-3$.
