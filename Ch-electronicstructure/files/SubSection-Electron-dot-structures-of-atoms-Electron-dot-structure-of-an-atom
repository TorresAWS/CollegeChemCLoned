In order to write the electron-dot structure of an atom, you just need to write down the symbol of the atom surrounded by the number of valence electrons located in the four directions of the space: top, bottom, right and left. In order to place the electrons, you start in any of the directions and fill one electron at a time. For example, for the case of three electrons we would have: \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0.2.4.,B} \hspace{.05in}. After the four direction has been filled, you need to start pairing the electrons. For example, for the case of five electrons we would have: \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2.4.6:,P} \hspace{.05in}. Another example, oxygen has six valence electrons and hence, the electron-dot structure would be \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4.6.,O}\hspace{.05in} Similarly, for the case of fluorine the  the electron-dot structure would be  \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4:6.,F} \hspace{.05in}. In the case of an ion, you need to add (if its an anion) or subtract (if its a cation) electrons, and for example the electron-dot structure of \ce{O^{2-}} is \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4:6:,O}\hspace{.05in}\ce{^{2-}}
