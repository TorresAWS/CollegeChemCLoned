The VSEPR model, also known as the valence shell electron-pair repulsion model, is a model that predicts the geometries of molecules made of nonmetals. This model predicts the atomic arrangement of the molecules with an emphasis on the shape of the arrangement. However, it is not a very accurate model to predict geometries and there are better methods to obtain molecular geometries. The model predicts, for example, that water molecules have a v-shaped geometry and not a linear geometry while giving an estimate of the angle between the two O-H bonds. Still, VSEPR is not accurate enough to predict the O-H bond length and more advanced methods should be used for this purpose.
The VSEPS model is based on the premise that the structure around a given atom results from minimizing the electron-pair repulsion. This way, the bonding and nonbonding pairs of electrons around a central atom are differently accounted for. Let us analyze a few cases in which the central atom only has bonding pairs of electrons. For example, the \ce{BeH2} molecule has two bonding pairs around Be and the arrangement that maximizes the distance between both pairs hence minimizing repulsion is a linear arrangement. Hence, the \ce{BeH2} molecule is linear with a 180$^{\circ}$ angle between both Be-H bonds. Another example would be the \ce{BH3} molecules, a molecule with three bonding pairs. The geometry that maximizes the distance between the three pairs hence minimizing repulsion is a trigonal planar structure in which the three bonding pairs are in the same plane with an angle of 120$^{\circ}$ between the three bonds. A final example would be the methane molecule (\ce{CH4}), a molecule with four bonding pairs. A tetrahedral arrangement with 109.5$^{\circ}$ between the C-H bonds is the most stable arrangement for this case.
