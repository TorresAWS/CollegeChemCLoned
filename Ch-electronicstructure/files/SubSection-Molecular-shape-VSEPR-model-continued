For the case of five bonds, the geometrical arrangement that minimizes the electron-pair interaction is a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement consisting of two pyramidal arrangements sharing a common base. The \ce{PH5} molecule presents this arrangement. In this arrangement, there are two different bond angles: 90$^{\circ}$ between the vertical and in-plane and 120$^{\circ}$ for the in-plane bonds. Finally, the octahedral structure minimizes the pair repulsion in the case of six bonds and for example, the \ce{SH6} molecule has an octahedral arrangement. In this arrangement, all bonds have a 90$^{\circ}$ angle. All atomic arrangements discussed above are presented in the diagram below.
