Let us analyze the case of the formation of the hypothetical \ce{Ne2} molecule from two He atoms. Each He atom has one $1s$ orbital with two electrons. Therefore, according to the Molecular orbital theory, both orbitals will combine to produce two MO's with a total of four electrons. The resulting MOs will be as well: $\sigma_{1s}$ and $\sigma_{1s}^*$. This time, MO configuration is: $\ce{He2}=\sigma_{1s}^2\sigma_{1s}^{*2}$. In general antibonding orbitals are not stable. In the \ce{He} molecule we stabilize the molecule by forming two $\sigma_{1s}^2$ orbitals, but we also destabilize the molecule by forming $\sigma_{1s}^{*2}$. Hence the \ce{He2} molecule will not be stable in compared to the atoms:\\
