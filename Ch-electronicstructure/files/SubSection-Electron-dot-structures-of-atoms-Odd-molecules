Lewis structures are based on the localized electron models that assume that molecules are made of atoms connected by means of pairs of electrons. Some molecules have an odd number of molecules and for those, the localized electron model does not work. An example is nitrogen monoxide \ce{NO} that has eleven electrons. Nitrogen monoxide forms as a result of the combustion of gasoline in car engines. The localized electron model does not handle well molecules with odd number of electrons and more advanced models would be required to describe the bonding state of these molecules.
