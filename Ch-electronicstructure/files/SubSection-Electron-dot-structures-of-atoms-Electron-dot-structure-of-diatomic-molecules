This section will address how to build up electron-dot structures of diatomic molecules. These would be the most simple electron-dot structures of molecules that you will see. The first step is 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item to set up the atoms in the molecule in the form of a line. After that, 
\item you need to count the total number of valence electrons in the molecule by adding the valence electrons of each atom (remember the number of valence electrons corresponds to the group number in the A notation, O is 6 as its group is VIA). 
\item compute the pairs of electrons--the total number of valence electrons divided by two; pairs of electrons are represented by lines
\item	you need to start distributing the pairs in the molecule in a very specific way: first connecting the atoms among themselves, and after placing the remaining pairs surrounding the atoms. Overall, each atom should be surrounded by four pairs with the exception of \ce{H} and \ce{B}.
\end{inparaenum}
