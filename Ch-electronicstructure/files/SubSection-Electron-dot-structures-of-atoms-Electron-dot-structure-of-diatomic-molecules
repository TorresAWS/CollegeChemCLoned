Electron-dot structures--or Lewis structures--of diatomic molecules are the most simple electron-dot structures of molecules that you will see. To obtain these structures, you need to follow the next steps. The first step is 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item to set up the atoms in the molecule in the form of a line. After that, 
\item you need to count the total number of valence electrons in the molecule by adding the valence electrons of each atom (remember the number of valence electrons corresponds to the group number in the A notation). Then
\item compute the pairs of electrons represented by lines--the total number of valence electrons divided by two. Finally, 
\item you need to start distributing the electron pairs in the molecule in a very specific way, first connecting the atoms among themselves, and then placing the remaining pairs surrounding the atoms. Following the octet rule, each atom except for \ce{H} and \ce{B} should be surrounded by four pairs, counting as pairs the bonds and lone pairs.
