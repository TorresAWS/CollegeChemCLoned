In order to build up the electron-dot structures of a molecule you needs to count the number of valence electrons. Each atom bring a different number of valence electrons to a molecule. For example, H brings one whereas O brings two. When you arrange the electron pairs in the molecule, each atoms should have the number of electrons that they bring. For example in this electron-dot structure \lewis{0:,H}\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:6:,Cl}\hspace{.05in} the hydrogen atom brings one electrons to the molecule, and in the molecule the atom owns one electrons, as in \lewis{0:,H}\hspace{.05in}  one of the dots belong to \ce{H} and the other belongs to the \ce{Cl}--the electrons are shared in a covalent bond. In the same way, the \ce{Cl} atom brings seven electrons and in the molecule it owns seven electrons, and has six electrons here \lewis{0:2:6:,Cl}\hspace{.05in} plus the one that shared with the hydrogen atom. In another words, the \lewis{0:,H}\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:6:,Cl}\hspace{.05in} electron-dot structure is the combination of \lewis{0.,H}\hspace{.05in} and \hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:4.6:,Cl}\hspace{.05in}. We say that the charges on each atom are zero, as each atom in the molecule owns the same number of electrons that it originally brings.
