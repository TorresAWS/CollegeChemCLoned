Protons, neutrons, and electrons make the atoms. Electrons--in particular valence electrons--are responsible for the main chemical properties of an atom. These electrons are loosely bound and can be exchanged easily with other atoms, in contrast to the strongly-tied core electrons. The electron-dot structure of an atom or a molecule--also called Lewis structures--is a visual representation of the electronic arrangement of the valence electrons. Atoms in a molecule will tend to be surrounded by eight electrons so that their electron configuration resembles a noble gas. This arrangement is known as the octet rule. This rule is responsible for the common negative charge of F, and the positive charge of Na: F ($[He]2s^22p^5$) can easily receive an extra electron producing ionic \ce{F^-} ($[He]2s^22p^6$=[Ne]), and atomic Na ($[Ne]3s^1$) can lose an electron producing ionic \ce{Na^+} ($[He]2s^22p^6=[Ne]$). There are a few exceptions. A remarkable one is the case of the hydrogen atom that follows the duet rule.
