Atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons--in particular valence electrons--are responsible for the main chemical properties of an atom. These electrons are tied weakly to the nucleus in comparison with the core electrons and hence they can be exchanged easily with other atoms. Atoms in a molecule, with a few exceptions such as the hydrogen case, will tend to be surrounded by eight electrons so that its electron configuration resembles a noble gas. This is known as the octet rule (the duet rule in the case of hydrogen), and this rule is responsible for the common negative charge of F and the positive charge of Na: F ($[He]2s^22p^5$) can easily receive an extra electron producing ionic \ce{F^-} ($[He]2s^22p^6$=[Ne]) and atomic Na ($[Ne]3s^1$) can lose an electron producing ionic \ce{Na^+} ($[He]2s^22p^6=[Ne]$). The electron-dot structure of an atom or a molecule is a visual representation of the electronic arrangement in an atom or a molecule.
