Lewis structures are just representations of the bonds in a molecule. These representations are based on the localized electron bonding model, that assumes that molecules are made of atoms that share pairs of electrons. This section will addressed more advanced models. In particular hybrid orbitals are mixtures of atomic orbitals in a molecule. Atoms contains electrons and these electrons are located in atomic orbitals. We call these atomic orbitals as they belong to atoms. When a few atomic orbitals mix together, they hybridize, that is they mingle forming combinations of orbitals called hybrid. For example, when a $s$ orbital hybridizes with a a single $p$ orbitals, we obtain a hybrid $sp$ orbital. At the same time, the $s$ orbital can hybridize with two different $p$ orbitals forming a $sp^2$ hybrid orbital. Hybrid orbitals are just a continuation of lewis structures and one can only obtain the hybrid orbitals of an atom in a molecule by means of the lewis structure. Therefore, at this point is very important you master the construction of lewis structures.
