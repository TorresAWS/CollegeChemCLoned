Atomic orbitals (AOs) combine to produce molecular orbitals (MOs). The combination of two atomic orbitals results in two new molecular orbitals: a bonding orbital and a antibonding orbital. Bonding MOs are more stable than the corresponding atomic orbitals. Antibonding MOs are less stable--they have a higher more positive energy--than the corresponding AOs. Antibonding orbitals are normally labeled with a $^*$ sign. Let us analyze both combinations of a $1s$ orbital. We can add both $1s$ orbital and the result is a bonding orbital, or we can substract both $1s$ orbitals and the result is an antibonding orbital, as the electron density cancels.
