Polarity is a key property when two liquids or two gases mix. If the mixing molecules have the same polar character they will be able to mix, whereas they will not mix when the polar character is different. For example, \ce{H2O} and  \ce{HCl} mix well as both are polar molecules. Differently, \ce{H2O} and \ce{CCl4} do not mix well, as while water is a polar molecule, carbon tetrachloride (or chloro methane) is a nonpolar molecule. Differences in polarity create immiscibility in liquids and gases.
Finally, methanol (\ce{CH3OH}) is a polar molecule as well. The central atom of a molecule (C) is connected to three hydrogens and an OH group. Hence this will be a polar molecule as one of the atoms attached to carbon is different. Both molecules, water, and methanol will mix as they have the same polarity. As a general rule: molecules with the same polarity (polar-polar or nonpolar-nonpolar) will mix.
