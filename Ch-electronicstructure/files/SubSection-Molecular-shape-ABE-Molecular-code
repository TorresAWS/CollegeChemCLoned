We will use the ABE code to identify the molecular geometry of more complex molecules, with bonds and lone pairs. This code is based on the Lewis structure of the molecule, with 
B refers to the number of atoms connected to the central atom in the molecule (number of bonded atoms), and E is the number of lone pairs on the central atom. The overall number of bonded atoms and lone pairs is called the number of electron groups. Corresponding geometry for different ABE codes is tabulated. For example, an \ce{AB2} molecule will be linear, whereas an \ce{AB2E2} is bent. The electron-dot structure of water and ammonia are:
 \begin{center} \chemfig{ H-[:0]\lewis{26,O}-H}\hspace{.05in} and  \hspace{.05in} \chemfig{\lewis{2,N}( (-[:0]H)(-[:180]H)(-[:270]H))} \hspace{.05in}\end{center}
Water has two bonds with the central atom and hence two Bs and two lone pairs on top of the central atom and hence two Es. The ABE code of water is \ce{AB2E2} and its geometry is bent. The ABE code of ammonia is \ce{AB3E}, as the molecule has three atoms connected to the central nitrogen and \ce{N} has a single lone pair. Its geometry would be trigonal pyramidal. Angles between the different bonds for the different atomic arrangements are also tabulated. For example, the angle between the two H-O bonds of water would be 104.5$^{\circ}$, whereas the angle between two of the N-H bonds of ammonia would be 107$^{\circ}$. The overall number of bonding and lone pairs is referred to as the number of electron regions and the molecular geometry of the molecule is not necessarily the geometry of the electron regions. For example, the molecule methane has four bonds and a tetrahedral geometry. Ammonia has two bonds and two lone pairs. The geometry of the electron regions is also tetrahedral with three bonds pointing toward the lower part of the tetrahedron and the lone pair pointing toward the upper part. At the same time, the molecular geometry of ammonia is trigonal pyramidal. For the case of water, we have that again the geometry of the four electron regions is tetrahedral whereas the molecular geometry is bent. We can also conclude that lone pairs require more room than bonding pairs and this has an impact on the molecular angles. For example, the angle between two bonds in a tetrahedron is 109.5$^{\circ}$ being this value is the same as the molecule angles of methane. Differently, the molecular angles of ammonia--a molecule with one lone pair--are 107$^{\circ}$, and the molecular angle of water--a molecule with two lone pairs--is 104.5$^{\circ}$. These results indicate that as the number of lone pairs increases the bonding pairs are more squeezed together.
