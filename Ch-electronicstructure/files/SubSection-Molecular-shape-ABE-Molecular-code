If the molecule contains two atoms, there is only a possible geometry these two atoms can exhibit, and this is a linear arrangement. For the case of more complex molecules, in order to identify the geometry you need to figure out the ABE code of the molecule. In this code B refers to the number of atoms connected to the central atom in a molecule, and E is the number of lone pairs on the central atom. For example, the electron-dot \hspace{.05in}\chemfig{ H-[:0]\lewis{26,O}-H}\hspace{.05in} structure has two bonds with the central atom \ce{B2} and two lone pairs on top of the central atom \ce{E2} and hence the ABE code of the molecule would be \ce{AB2E2}. Another example the ABE code for  ammonia  \hspace{.05in} \chemfig{\lewis{2,N}( (-[:0]H)(-[:180]H)(-[:270]H))} \hspace{.05in}  would be \ce{AB3E}, as the molecule has three atoms connected to the central nitrogen and and \ce{N} has a single lone pair. You can find a list of the equivalence between ABE codes and the molecular geometry in Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter}. In order to predict the geometry of a molecule, once you have the ABE code, Table \ref{tab:vsepr} will give you the geometry. For example, an \ce{AB2} molecule will be linear, whereas an \ce{AB2E2} is bent. The bond angles are also indicated in the table, and for example a \ce{CO2} molecule, which will be linear will have a $180^{\circ}$ angle. This means both C-O bonds will form a line.
