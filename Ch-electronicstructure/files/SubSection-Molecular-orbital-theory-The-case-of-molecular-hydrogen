Let us analyze the case of the formation of the \ce{H2} molecule from two Hydrogen atoms. Each H atom has one $1s$ orbital. Therefore, according to the Molecular orbital theory, both orbitals will combine to produce two MO's. When you combine $s$ atomic orbitals, the resulting MOs are always sigma. Sigma refers to the symmetry of the orbital. Therefore, the resulting MOs will be $\sigma_{1s}$ and $\sigma_{1s}^*$. Each AO contains one electron, hence the set of MO's will also contain two electrons that will occupy the most stable $\sigma_{1s}$. The resulting MO diagram is below. In this diagram, the atomic orbitals of H are on the left and right, whereas the MO's are in the center. We can also give the MO configuration as $\ce{H2}=\sigma_{1s}^2$. The hydrogen molecule is more stable than the separate hydrogen atoms. Why is that? the molecular orbitals of the molecule are lower in energy than the atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. This means they have more energy--as energy is negative that also means they are more stable. That is the reason why the hydrogen molecule is a stable existing molecule and takes energy to break down this molecule into atoms.
