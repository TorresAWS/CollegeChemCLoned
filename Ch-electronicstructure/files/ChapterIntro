\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}I}{n} nature molecules can found in a myriad of different shapes. Some like carbon dioxide are one-dimensional or linear, others like methane have a shape that expands in the three directions of the space--they have a three-dimensional shape. The shape of molecules results from the chemical bonds connecting atoms in a molecule and from the existence of lone pairs of electrons. This chapter covers the analysis of the molecular shape and gains insight into advanced models of the chemical bond. After studying the ideas in this chapter you will be able to draw the connections between the atoms of a molecule and to draft Lewis structures used as graphical representations of the molecular bonds. At the end of the chapter, we will address the idea of molecular polarity, which results from the distribution of charge in a molecule. Polarity will understand the reasons why you use soap to get rid of oil while doing dished.
