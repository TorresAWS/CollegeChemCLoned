This section deals with bond and molecule polarity. A chemical bond will be polar or nonpolar depending on the tendency of the atoms in a bond to attract the electrons the bond. Polar bonds results in the existence of a permanent dipole moment that makes a molecule polar. Polar molecules can interact with polar molecules and mix.
