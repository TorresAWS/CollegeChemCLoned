\ce{CCl4} is a nonpolar molecule, and \ce{H2O} is a polar molecule. As both have different polar character they will not mix together. If you mix water and \ce{CCl4}, tow phases will remain instead of a single mixed liquid phase.
As a general rule: molecules with different polarity (polar-nonpolar) will not mix. Another example will be water and oil. Water is polar, and oil is a nonpolar molecule. As a consequence these two molecules will not mix together. Soap has a polar and non-polar part. In order to remove oil from water, soap helps mixing both polar water and nonpolar oil.
