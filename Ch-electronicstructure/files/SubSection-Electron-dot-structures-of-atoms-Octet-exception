The octet rule assumes that all atoms are surrounded by eight pairs of electrons (either lone pairs or bonds) as atoms tend to achieve a stable noble gas configuration. However, not all atoms follow the octet rule. Is fair to say that most of the second-period atoms, C, N, O, and F follow the octet rule. Hydrogen does not follow the octet rule. It follows the duet rule being surrounded by a single pair of electrons. Similarly, Boron does not follow the octet rule and tends to form a maximum of three bonds. The Lewis structure of a boron compound is presented below:
\setlewis[1em]{6pt}{1.5ex}{}\begin{center}\setatomsep{25pt}\chemfig[  remember picture]{B ( (-[:0 ]\lewis{,H}) (-[:120 ]\lewis{,H}) (-[:240 ]\lewis{,H}))} \hspace{2cm}\setlewis[1em]{2pt}{1.5ex}{}\setatomsep{25pt}\chemfig[  remember picture]{P ( (-[:45 ]\lewis{026,Cl}) (-[:90 ]\lewis{024,Cl}) (-[:180 ]\lewis{246,Cl}) (-[:270 ]\lewis{046,Cl}) (-[:315 ]\lewis{026,Cl}))} \end{center}
Boron and hydrogen have a reduced octet, with less than eight electrons.
At the same time, atoms belonging to the third period (e.g. S, P) do not tend to follow the octet rule. They tend to have an expanded octet, being surrounded by more than eight electrons. This is because the model behind the octet rule, the localized electron model, assumes that all atoms use their s and p orbitals to create bonds. However, atoms in the third period can also use the d orbitals with can fit extra pairs of electrons. The Lewis structure of a phosphorous compound is presented above. When dealing with expanded octets it is safe to assume that the central atom locates the expanded octet and hence the extra pairs of electrons.
