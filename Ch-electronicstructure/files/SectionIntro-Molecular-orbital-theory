The molecular orbital theory is the most advanced bonding theory able to describe bond energies and bond lengths. Atomic orbitals are waves. When combining two waves one can obtain two possible results: a constructive combination and a destructive combination. The molecular orbital theory assumes that atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals. For every two atomic orbitals you can obtain two possible molecular orbitals: one is called bonding orbital, resulting from the constructive combination, and another one is called antibonding orbital, resulting from the destructive combination. In this section, we will learn how to interpret molecular orbital diagrams.
