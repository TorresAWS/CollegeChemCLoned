 
Methanol (\ce{CH3OH}) is a polar molecule as well. The central atom of molecule (C) is connected to three hydrogens and an OH group. Hence this will be a polar molecule as one of the atoms attached to carbon is different. Both molecules, water, and methanol will mix as they have the same polarity. Methane (\ce{CH4}) is a nonpolar molecule, as the four polar C-H bonds compensate each other. Similarly, \ce{CCl4}, tetrachloro methene, is another nonpolar molecule, for the same reason. Both molecules, \ce{CH4} and \ce{CCl4} will mix together. As a general rule: molecules with the same polarity (polar-polar or nonpolar-nonpolar) will mix.
