Now we will address how to build up electron-dot structures of more complex molecules given that one of the atoms is the central atom and the others are connected to this central atom. 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
The first step is \item to arrange the atoms in the molecule, in the form of a central atom and the remaining atoms around it; the central atom is the one with a lower index in the molecule (e.g. in \ce{H2O} is \ce{O} or in \ce{NH3} is \ce{N}). After that, 
\item you need to count the total number of valence electrons in the molecule, dividing this number by two to obtain the number of pairs of electrons represented by lines. In the following  
\item you need to connect the surrounding atoms to the central atom with electron pairs, and then
\item place electron pairs on top of the surrounding atoms, always placing a maximum of four atoms. Finally 
\item place the remaining pairs in the central atom. 
\end{inparaenum} 
Overall, each atom should be surrounded by four pairs (this is the octet rule) with the exception of \ce{H} and \ce{B} which should be surrounded by one and three pairs respectively.  When drawing Lewis structures it is not important the atom arrangement (if the molecule looks like a line, a triangle or so) as long as the connectivity (which atom goes in the center and in the surroundings) is correct.
