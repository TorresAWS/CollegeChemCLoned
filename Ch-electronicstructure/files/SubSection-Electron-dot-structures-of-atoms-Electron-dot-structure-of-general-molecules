Now we will address how to build up electron-dot structures of more complex molecules. The first step is (a) to arrange the atoms in the molecule, in the form of a central atom and the remaining atoms around it; the central atom is the one with a lower index in the molecule (e.g. in \ce{H2O} is \ce{O} or in \ce{NH3} is \ce{N}). After that, (b) you need to count the total number of valence electrons in the molecule, by adding the valence electrons of each atoms. Then you (c) calculate the pairs of electrons--the total number of valence electrons divided by two; pairs of electrons are represented by lines. In the following (d) you need to start distributing the pairs in the molecule in a very specific way (this is the key to building good electron-dot structures): first connecting the surrounding atoms to the central atom, after placing pairs on top of the surrounding atoms and finally by placing the remaining pairs in the central atom. Each atom should be surrounded by four pairs (this is the octet rule) with the exception of \ce{H} and \ce{B} as they do not follow the octet rule. When you have the final electron-dot structure, the pairs of electrons (or lines) that connect two atoms are called \begin{it}bonds\end{it}, whereas the pairs not involved in an connection are called \begin{it}lone pairs\end{it}. A very important note is that, at this point, is not that important the atom arrangement (if the molecule looks like a line, a triangle or so) as long as the connectivity (which atom goes in the center and in the surroundings) is correct.
