Often times you are going to encounter electron-dot structures like the ones below
 \begin{center}  \chemfig{\lewis{4:,N}~\lewis{0:,N}}\hspace{.05in} and\hspace{.05in} \chemfig{\lewis{3:5:,O}=\lewis{1:7:,O}} \end{center}
in which the atoms are connected by means of multiple bonds, double or triple bond. Multiple bonds are formed while constructing electron-dot structures in order to minimize large atomic charges while preserving the octet rule. Look for example the lewis structure for the \ce{HCN} molecule. The Lewis structure on the left has a positive center and a negative center. On this structure, carbon do not follow the octet rule and neither does nitrogen. We can minimize the large atomic charges while enforcing the octet rule by moving lone pairs from the atoms into the bond. For example, if we move one of the lone pairs of nitrogen into the C-N bond we have the Lewis structure in the center. In this structure above, even when the charges are now low, still carbon and nitrogen do not follow the octet rule as they are not surrounded by four pairs of electrons. We can solve this problems by moving one more time a lone pair from N to the C-N bond forming the Lewis structure on the right, the most stable structure as the atomic charges are small and the octet rule is preserved.

As you can see in this example, multiple bonds arise in Lewis structures to minimize large atomic charges. All the structures above are a set of different Lewis structures of the same molecule, each with a different stability. These structure are referred to as resonant structures.
