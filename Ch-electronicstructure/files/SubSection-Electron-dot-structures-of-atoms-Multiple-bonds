Often times you are going to encounter electron-dot structures like\hspace{.05in} \chemfig{\lewis{4:,N}~\lewis{0:,N}}\hspace{.05in} in which the atoms are connected by means of a triple bond. You will also encounter double bonds \hspace{.05in} \chemfig{\lewis{3:5:,O}=\lewis{1:7:,O}}\hspace{.05in}  and single bonds. These are called multiple bonds and are formed while constructing electron-dot structures in order to avoid having atoms with atomic charges different than zero. Charged atoms in a molecule are in general not favorable. When you build electron-dot structures and you end up having large atomic charges, you can avoid that by moving electrons from the atom into the bond, hence creating multiple bonds.
