Let's analyze now the mixing of two $2p_x$ orbitals of two oxygen atoms to make an \ce{O2} molecule. Mind that $p$ orbitals look like dumbbells and each side of the dumbbell is called a lobe. In the $p_x$ orbital the positive lobe is on the right side and the negative love on the left side. When combining both $2p_x$ if we add both orbitals we obtain a bonding orbital and if we subtract them we obtain an antibonding orbital. Both of these orbitals are called $\sigma$ orbitals, as the lobes of the orbitals mixing go through the axes of the molecule being formed--the molecule is located in the X axis (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Sigma-orbitals}). Differently, if we combine two $2p_y$ orbitals we will obtain two $\pi$ orbitals, as the lobes of the molecular orbital is perpendicular to the axes of the molecule being formed (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Pi-orbitals}).
The first orbital is bonding as both lobes overlap constructively, whereas the second orbital is antibonding as both lobes cancel out.
