To identify the ABE code we need to identify first the central and peripheral atoms. For some more complex molecules, there might not seem to be a central atom. An example of this case can be found in acetic acid. 
\begin{center}
\chemfig{C((-[:90]H)(-[:180]H)(-[:270]H)(-[:0]C(( ((=[:90]\Lewis{13,O})-[:0]\Lewis{26,O}-[:0]H)))))}
\end{center}
In the molecule we have a carbon atom connected to three hydrogens and to another carbon which at the same time is connected to two oxygens, one of these is also connected to the final hydrogen. For this case, we just need to identify different geometry centers, that is, atoms that are central to the other connections and which are connected to at least two atoms. For this molecule, we have three central atoms. For each central atom, there will be a molecular arrangement. For example, the ABE code for the left carbon is \ce{AB4} whereas for the right carbon is \ce{AB3}. The geometry for the left-center would be tetrahedral, whereas for the right center would be planar trigonal. The right oxygen is also a central atom connected to carbon and hydrogen. The ABE code for this center is \ce{AB2E2} and the geometry is bent.
Furthermore, in the ABE code double bonds count as a single bonding pair. For example, the Lewis structure of carbon dioxide is:
\hspace{.05in} \chemfig{ \lewis{35,O}=[:0]C=\lewis{17,O}}\hspace{.05in}.
The ABE code for carbon dioxide would be \ce{AB2} and its geometry would be linear with a $180^{\circ}$ angle between the two C=O bonds. In the case of resonance, with several Lewis structures contributing to the chemical bond, any structure would predict the VSEPR geometry.
Finally, it is important to stress that the VSPER model is just a simple model and we should be careful when predicting quantitative information. For example, we have that both molecules ammonia and phosphine, \ce{NH3} and \ce{PH3}, both with code \ce{AB3E} have a trigonal pyramidal geometry. However, whereas the experimental bond angle of ammonia is 107$^{\circ}$--close to the value predicted by the model--the bond angle for phosphine is 94$^{\circ}$--very different than the angle predicted by the VSEPR model. Still, this model is good enough to predict general molecular structures.
