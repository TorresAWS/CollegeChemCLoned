\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Indicate the number of valence electrons for the following atoms: N, O, C and S, and the number of pairs of electrons of the following molecules: \ce{NH3}, and \ce{CO2}.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Nitrogen is in group VA and hence it has five valence electrons (5\ce{e^-}). Oxygen belongs to the group VIA and C belong to IVA, hence they have wiz and four valence electrons, respectively. For the molecules, we have that ammonia has 8 electrons (nitrogen has five valence electrons and each hydrogen has one electron) that correspond to four pairs, whereas carbon dioxide has 16 electrons (carbon has four electrons and each oxygen has six) and eight pairs.\\
