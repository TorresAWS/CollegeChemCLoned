Construct the electron-dot structure of \ce{H2O} indicating the number of bonds and lone pairs.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf} we first arrange the atoms in the molecule as \ce{H}\hspace{.05in}\ce{O}\hspace{.05in}\ce{H}. The central atom is \ce{O} as oxygen has the lower index in the \ce{H2O} molecule--the index for O is one and the index for H is two.
\item \begin{bf}Step two:\end{bf} now we count the total number of valence electrons, including all atoms: 2xH(1) and O(6) that gives a total of eight electrons.
 \item \begin{bf}Step three:\end{bf} let us count the pairs of electrons; we have eight electrons and that is four pairs.
\item \begin{bf}Step four:\end{bf} now we distribute the pair on each atoms knowing that each atom has to have four pairs with the exception of hydrogen that can only be surrounded by one pair.
\lewis{0:,H}\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:6:,O}\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:,H}\hspace{.05in} and using lines instead of pairs (this is not necessary but makes the electron-dot structure look better) we obtain \chemfig{ H-[:0]\lewis{26,O}-H}\hspace{.05in}. The molecule has two bonds, each one connecting and H to the oxygen atom and two lone pairs located on the oxygen atom.
