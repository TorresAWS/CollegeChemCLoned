The carbon atoms brings four electrons and in the molecule it is surrounded by eight electrons, five of which belongs to it. Hence the charge of C is $-1$; this means that carbon has one extra electron. Each hydrogen brings one electron and in the molecule each hydrogen has one electron (they share two electrons with C, one for C and one for H). The final lewis structure with the local charge of carbon can be indicated as: 
\begin{center}\setatomsep{2.25em}
