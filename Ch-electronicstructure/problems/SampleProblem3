Construct the electron-dot structure of \ce{HCl}.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We first arrange the atoms in the molecule as indicated below and then we count the number of valence electrons: H(1) and Cl(7) that gives a total of eight electrons. We have four pairs of electrons.
\begin{center} \ce{H}\hspace{.05in}\ce{Cl}\end{center}
Now we distribute the pair on each atoms knowing that each atom has to have four pairs with the exception of hydrogen that can only be surrounded by one pair. We can use lines instead of pairs
\begin{center} \lewis{0:,H}\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:6:,Cl}\hspace{.15in}or \hspace{.15in}  \chemfig{ H-[:0]\lewis{026,Cl}}\hspace{.05in}\end{center}
