Construct the electron-dot structure of \ce{HCl}.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf} we first arrange the atoms in the molecule as \ce{H}\hspace{.05in}\ce{Cl}. 
\item \begin{bf}Step two:\end{bf} now we count the number of valence electrons: H(1) and Cl(7) that gives a total of eight electrons.
 \item \begin{bf}Step three:\end{bf} let us count the pairs of electrons; we have eight electrons and that is four pairs.
\item \begin{bf}Step four:\end{bf} now we distribute the pair on each atoms knowing that each atom has to have four pairs with the exception of hydrogen that can only be surrounded by one pair.
\lewis{0:,H}\hspace{.05in}\lewis{0:2:6:,Cl}\hspace{.05in}, using lines instead of pairs (this is not necessary but makes the electron-dot structure look better) we obtain\\
 \chemfig{ H-[:0]\lewis{026,Cl}}\hspace{.05in}.
\end{enumerate}
