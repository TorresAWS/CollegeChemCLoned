Construct the electron-dot structure of \ce{O2}.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\color{white}\arabic*}]
\item \begin{bf}Step one:\end{bf} 
We first arrange the atoms in the molecule as 
\begin{center}\ce{O}\hspace{.05in}\ce{O}\hspace{.05in}\end{center}
Now we count the total number of valence electrons, including all atoms: 2xO(6) that gives a total of twelve electrons. Let us count the pairs of electrons; we have twelve electrons and that is six pairs.
Then we distribute the pairs, fist connecting the atoms \chemfig{O-O} (we have five extra pairs to distribute at this point), and we place the remaining pairs on top of the oxygen atoms 
\begin{center} \chemfig{\lewis{246,O}-\lewis{17,O}}\end{center}
The right oxygen do not follow the octet rule. In order to enforce the octet rule we move lone pairs into the bond  
\begin{center}\chemfig{\lewis{35,O}=\lewis{17,O}}\hspace{.05in}\end{center}   
\end{enumerate}
