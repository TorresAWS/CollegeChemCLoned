Identify the polar character (polar/nonpolar) of the following molecules: \ce{BF3}, \ce{SO2} and \ce{CH4}.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Let us analyze the geometries of the three molecules:
\begin{center}\hspace{.05in}\chemfig{B(-[:0]\lewis{026,F})(-[:120]\lewis{024,F})(-[:240]\lewis{046,F})}\hspace{0.5cm}\hspace{.05in}\chemfig{\lewis{2,S}(=[:330]\lewis{06,O})(-[:210]\lewis{246,O})}\hspace{0.5cm}  \chemfig{C(-[:0]H)(-[:90]H)(-[:180]H)(-[:270]H)}\hspace{.05in}\end{center}

The bonds on \ce{SO2} do not cancel out, as they do not point in opposite directions. Hence this  molecule is polar. On the other hand, the bonds on methane and \ce{BF3} cancel each other out and hence even when the C-H  and B-F bonds is polar, these two molecules would be non-polar.\\
