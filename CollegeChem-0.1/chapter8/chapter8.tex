\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{he} air we all breath contains numerous gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Some of these gases are indeed essential for life. As an example, living creature take up carbon dioxide to give off oxygen, and water is produced by the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen gas. Other gases are dangerous for life. An example is carbon monoxide, which results from gas stoves, heating systems and fire. This is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can bind to the blood displacing oxygen. As a consequence, carbon monoxide can build up in closed environments causing death. This chapter deals with the properties of gases. You will learn how to calculate the volume or pressure of a gas, characterizing its state. You will also learn how to work with mixtures of gases and for example predict the pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere, which contains numerous gases.

\section{Gases and its properties}
Gases contain atomic or molecular particles. They have very different properties than liquids or solids. The particles of a gas are spread and far away from each other. Liquids, on the other hand are made of loose particles that interact by means of weak forces. Solids on the other hand are packed materials and its particles, atoms or molecules, are closer together. This section covers the different properties of gases.

\item[\docfilehook{Gases in the periodic table}{Gases in the periodic table}] 
Some of the elements in the periodic table are molecular gases, resulting of the combination of two atoms of the same element. For example, molecular oxygen (\ce{O2}) is gas. Similarly, molecular nitrogen (\ce{N2}), molecular hydrogen (\ce{H2}), molecular chlorine (\ce{C2}), or molecular fluorine (\ce{F2}) are all diatomic gases--they contain two atoms of the same element. Other gases result of the combination of two different non-metals. Examples are carbon monoxide (\ce{CO}) or dioxide (\ce{CO2}), and nitrogen monoxide (\ce{NO}) or dioxide (\ce{NO2}). The nobel gases (Ne, He, Ar) also exist in gas state.

\item[\docfilehook{Volume}{Volume}] The volume of a gas (V) is the amount of space it occupies, and gases fully occupy the volume of its container. Liters (L) and milliliters (mL) are units of volume. Liter is a cubic unit and one litter equals to a cubic decimeter ($dm^3$). Similarly, one milliliter (mL) equals to a cubic centimeter ($cm^3$). 
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   \frac{1 \text{ L} }{1\text{ }dm^3}}\quad  \boxed{ \frac{1\text{ mL}}{1\text{ }cm^3}}   
\end{equation*}
In this chapter all formulas require the use of litters.
\item[\docfilehook{Temperature}{Temperature}] The temperature (T) of a gas is related to the speed (the average velocity) of gas particles. The higher the temperature the higher the particles' speed. Although there are different units of temperature such as Kelvin (K) or celsius (C$^{\circ}$), in this chapter all formulas require the use of Kelvin temperature ($T_K=T_C+273$).
\item[\docfilehook{Amount of gas}{Amount of gas}] The amount of a gas (n) refers to the quantity of gas particles. The bigger the amount of gas, the larger the amount of gas particles. The amount of gas is measured in moles or grams.
\begin{marginfigure}[0cm]%%%%%%%MARGIN FIGURE
\includegraphics{chapter8/figure4}
\caption{Gas pressure is due to the collisions of the gas particles with the walls of its container.}
\end{marginfigure}%%%%%%%MARGIN FIGURE

\item[\docfilehook{Pressure, P}{Pressure, P}] The particles of a gas are constantly moving. On its movement, they frequently hit the walls of its container, like the raindrops hitting the ceiling when it rains. When they hit the walls they exert a pressure, and pressure is defined as the force acting on certain area. The larger pressure the stronger the collisions with the walls and the higher the frequency of collision--the stronger the force applied on the walls. Imagine you are driving a motorcycle. While you drive you can feel the collision of the air's particle with your face. The faster you go the higher pressure. 
The value of air's pressure is measured with a barometer and depends on your location on the earth--in particular your altitude--as well as the weather. If you are at the sea level the atmospheric pressure is one unit of pressure (one atm), due to the air that you have on top of you. If you climb a mountain, the pressure decreases, as there is less air on top of you. The higher you are with respect to the sea level, the lower the air pressure. The weather also affects pressure, and in hot days the pressure of air is higher, whereas on a cold day pressure is lower. \\
Units of pressure are: atmospheres (atm), torr, pascals (Pa) or millimeters of mercury (mmHg). In order to covert pressure units, you can use the following conversion factors:\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1}{Add these conversions into your flashcard.}
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   \frac{1 \text{ atm} }{760\text{ mmHg} }}\quad  \boxed{ \frac{1\text{ torr}}{1\text{ mmHg}}}\quad  \boxed{ \frac{1\text{ atm}}{101325\text{ Pa}}}   
\end{equation*}
one millimeters of mercury (mmHg) is the same as 1 torr. As a note, the name torr knowledges the person who invented the barometer: Torricelli, an Italian physicist.


\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
An oxygen sample has a pressure of 2 atm. Convert this value to: (a) mmHg and (b) Pascals.

\section{Ideal gas law}
Ideal gases are gases made of particles that do not interact with each other, differently real gases contain particles that interact, often times strongly, with each other. The temperature, pressure, volume and number of moles of a gas are not independent. They are related by a law: the ideal gas law. In this section we will introduce this law in two different forms.
\sloppy 
\begin{description}
\item[\docfilehook{Ideal gas law in terms of moles}{Ideal gas law in terms of moles}] 
The ideal gas law says:\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1}{Add this formula to your flashcard.}

\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\boxed{  PV=nRT} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Ideal Gas Law}}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P$   is the pressure of the gas in atm
\item $V$    is the volume of the gas in L 
 \item $n$   is the number of moles of the gas
\item $T$   is the temperature of the gas in K
\item $R$   is the constant of the gas $0.082\frac{\text{atm}\cdot \text{L}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{K}}$
\end{where}
Imagine for example that you inflate a ballon with you mouth, introducing air particles into the ballon.
While the number of particles inside the ballon grows, its volume will grow too. More particles will collide with the walls of the ballon and hence, the pressure inside the ballon will also increase.

The ideal gas law in terms of density is:\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1}{Add this formula to your flashcard.}

\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\boxed{  P\cdot MW=DRT} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Ideal Gas Law in terms of D}}

\section{Change of gas properties}
The previous section addressed the properties of an ideal gas.  However, as all properties of a gas are related, if we modify one the others will change too. This section covers situations in which one of the gas properties changes (e.g. V changes) and you need to predict the change of another gas property (e.g. P). For example, imagine you compress a ballon with your hand. The temperature and number of moles of the gas inside the ballon are constant, as the balloon is closed and in contact with the atmosphere. Differently, the pressure and volume will change. In particular, the volume will decrease and the pressure will increase. This means that the gas particles will hit the ballon harder and with more frequency.
\sloppy 
\begin{description}
\item[\docfilehook{Pressure-Volume change}{Pressure-Volume change}] 
If temperature and the number of moles of a gas are kept constant the product of pressure and volume will remain constant too. This is the case of the balloon-pressing example. We call this Boyle's Law:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  P_1\cdot V_1=P_2\cdot V_2} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Boyle's law}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P_1, V_1$   are the initial pressure and volume
 \item $P_2, V_2$   are the final pressure and volume
\end{where}
%\begin{marginfigure}[0cm]%%%%%%%MARGIN FIGURE
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,scale=0.5]{chapter8/figure6}
%\caption{Warming an aerosol container will increase the pressure of gas inside}
%\end{marginfigure}%%%%%%%MARGIN FIGURE
\item[\docfilehook{Pressure-Temperature change}{Pressure-Temperature change}] 
Imagine you have a gas container with rigid walls, so that its volume and the number of particles inside will remain constant--think for example of an aerosol container. What will be the effect of warming up the container? You can guess that the container might explode. If we keep the number of moles and the volume of the container fixed, the pressure and temperature of the gas are related by means of  Gay-Lussac's law:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  \frac{P_1} {T_1}=\frac{P_2} {T_2}} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Gay-Lussac's law}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P_1, T_1$   are the initial pressure and temperature
 \item $P_2, T_2$   are the final pressure and temperature
\end{where}
\begin{marginfigure}[0cm]%%%%%%%MARGIN FIGURE
\includegraphics {chapter8/figure7}
\caption{An hot air ballon will rise up as air's density decreases with temperature}
\end{marginfigure}%%%%%%%MARGIN FIGURE

\item[\docfilehook{Volume-Moles change}{Volume-Moles change}] 
Imagine a hot air ballon. Air comes in and out of the ballon as it is not a closed ballon. Hence the pressure on the ballon is the same as the atmospheric pressure. Also as the ballon is in contact with the air the temperature will be constant. If you inflate the ballon with hot air, the volume of the ballon and the number of moles are related by Avogadros's law:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  \frac{V_1} {n_1}=\frac{V_2} {n_2}} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Gay-Lussac's law}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $V_1, n_1$   are the initial volume and number of moles
 \item $V_2, n_2$   are the final volume and number of moles
\end{where}

In order to solve problems in which two of the gas variables are kept fixed and the other two are fixed, one needs to apply the ideal gas law at the initial and final state to then divide both formulas. Imagine the situation in which you have a 1L hot air ballon with 1 moles of a gas and you add gas to a total of 5 moles. You want to calculate the final volume after you inflate the volume, knowing the temperature and pressure are kept constant. The initial state corresponds to 1L and 1 moles of gas and the  final estate corresponds to an unknown volume and 5 moles. Using the ideal gas formula twice you have:
\begin{equation}
  \left.
  \raisebox{0pt}[30pt]{\smash{$\begin{array}{r@{}l@{\,}l}
   &  PV_1=n_1RT \\
   \\ 
    & PV_1=n_1RT \\
  \end{array}$}}
  \right\} \quad \frac{PV_1}{PV_2}=\frac{n_1RT}{n_2RT} 
\end{equation}
as some of the variables of the cancel out:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\cancel{P}V_1}{\cancel{P}V_2}=\frac{n_1\cancel{RT}}{n_2\cancel{RT}} 
\end{equation}
and you end up with Avogadros' law. If you plug the numbers into the formula:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1L}{V_2}=\frac{1 \text{ mol}}{5 \text{ mol}} 
\end{equation}
and you get a final volume of 5L.

\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
A 3L gas sample has a pressure of 5 atm. If the pressure increases to 10 atm at fixed temperature and number of moles, calculate the final volume of the gas.

From the problem we have the following data:

\end{tcbitemize}%%% DATA BOX
We need to apply the ideal gas formula to the initial state and final state and divide both formulas. The number of moles and the temperature are constant and will cancel out from both equations:

   &  P_1V_1=nRT \\

  \right\} \quad \frac{P_1V_1}{P_2V_2}=\frac{nRT}{nRT} 
\end{equation}
Plugging the values:
\begin{equation}
\frac{P_1V_1}{P_2V_2}=\frac{nRT}{nRT} 
\end{equation}
and solving:
\begin{equation}
\frac{3\cdot 5}{10\cdot V_2}=1
\end{equation}
the final volume will be 1.5 L.

A 4 atm gas sample has a temperature of 300K. If we decrease its temperature to 200K at fixed volume and number of moles, calculate the final pressure of the gas.\\
\flushright Answer: 2.66 atm.
\end{example}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
\item[\docfilehook{Relating the different variables of a gas}{Relating the different variables of a gas}] 
The questions is now, if we increase the pressure at fixed number of moles and pressure, how do we know if the volume will increase or perhaps decrease? Similarly, if for example the number of gas moles increase at fixed pressure and volume, will the temperature of the gas increase or perhaps decrease. We can answer these questions by means of the ideal gas law. If the variables that we need to relate are in the same side of the equation (e.g. P and V) then if one of the variables increase the other will decrease. Differently, If the gas variables to relate are located in opposite sides of the gas law (e.g. P and T) then both will change in the same direction. For example, let us consider the changes of P and V (at fixed n and T). As they are in the same side of the ideal gas law ($\textcolor{dgreen}{PV}=nRT$), if P increases V will decrease. Differently, for the change of P and T (at fixed V and n), as both variables are in opposite sides of the ideal gas law ($\textcolor{dgreen}PV=nR\textcolor{dgreen}T$), if P increases, T will increase as well.

\section{Mixtures of gases and gas stoichiometry}
The air is a mixture of different gases. It contains oxygen (\ce{O2}) and nitrogen (\ce{N2}) as well as other gases such as carbon dioxide, argon, or water vapor. Only 21\% of the air is made of oxygen and 78.2\% of nitrogen. The other gases represent 0.8\% of the air. The atmospheric pressure is 1 atm and results from the pressure of all the components of the air. Each gas exerts a partial pressure and all combined exert the total atmospheric pressure. In this section you will learn how to work with mixtures of gases.This section also covers the use of the molar volume to relate moles and volume at standard conditions.

\sloppy 
\begin{description}
\item[\docfilehook{Partial and total pressure}{Partial and total pressure}] 
Imagine you have a container with 1atm of Ar, and nother container of the same volume containing 1 atm of Ne. If you combine the containers into a single container (and temperature does not change), hence the pressure in the container will result from both gases and will be 2 atm. Inside the mixed container, 2 atm will the the total pressure ($P_{Total}$), whereas the partial pressure of each gas ($p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$) will be 1 atm. Dalton's Law says that the total pressure results from adding the partial pressure of each gas:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  P_{Total}=p_1+p_2+\dots } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Dalton's Law}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Medical Air is a odorless gas made mostly of nitrogen and oxygen,  administer by ventilator in hospital settings with an operating gauge pressure of 3 atm. If the oxygen pressure inside a container is 2.37 atm, calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen in the mixture.

\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
The problem gives the total pressure of the mixture and the partial pressure of one of the components. By using Dalton's law, we know that if the total pressure is 3atm and the partial pressure of oxygen is 2.37, hence the partial pressure of the other component has to be 0.63 atm.

\end{marginfigure} 

\item[\docfilehook{Mole fraction}{Mole fraction}] The mole fraction ($X_A$) of a gas (A) in a mixture of gas is just the number of moles of this gas over the total number of moles in the mixture. The larger the mole fraction of a gas in a mixture the more molecules of that specific gas are there in the mixture with respect to all components
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  X_A = \frac{n_A}{n_A + n_B + \dots} }
\end{equation*}
For a mixture of gases, the partial pressure of a gas ($p_A$) is related to the mole fraction of that gas ($X_A$) and the total pressure of the mixture of gases ($P_{Total}$):
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  p_A=X_A\cdot P_{Total}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
A mixture of gases with a total pressure of 2 atm contains 3 moles of Ar, 3 moles of He and 1 moles of Ne. Calculate the partial pressure of each component on the mixture. 
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We calculate first the mole fraction for each component of the mixture. As the total number of moles if 7 moles and there are 3 moles of Ar, its mole fraction is 0.43. Similarly, the mole fraction for He is 0.43 and for Ne is 0.14. To calculate the partial pressure of each gas you just need to multiply its mole fraction by the total pressure (2 atm). Hence: $p_{Ar}$=0.86atm, $p_{He}$=0.86atm and $p_{Ne}$=0.28atm

\item[\docfilehook{Molar volume}{Molar volume}] 
If we work at STP conditions the volume of one mole of gas equals to 22.4L, and we refer to this relationship as the molar volume.\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1}{Add this relation into your flashcard.}
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  \frac{1 mol} {22.4\text{ L at STP}} } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Molar Volume}}

This relationship allows us to carry stoichiometric calculations in chemical reaction involving gases.


\item[\docfilehook{stoichiometry and gases}{}] If you encounter chemical reactions with gases, the molar volume relation allows you to carry stoichiometric calculations. Why is this important? Imagine you have this reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{ $\underset{\text{\large 3L}}{\ce{2H2(g)}}$ + O2(g)  -> $\underset{\text{\large xL}}{\ce{2H2O(g)}}$  } \end{center}
Gases are measured by means of their pressure and is more convenient to speak about liters of hydrogen than moles of hydrogen or grams of hydrogen, as hydrogen is a gas. This way, if we start by mixing 3L of \ce{H2} we would like to know how much water is being produced. In order to calculate this, we will use the stoichiometric coefficients. In previous chapters we saw that these numbers represent moles and the units of these numbers is mol. If the reaction deals with gases you want to interpret the stoichiometric coefficients in terms of liters. This way:
\begin{equation*}
x=3\cancel{\text{ L of }\ce{H2}} \times \dfrac{\text{2 L of }\ce{H2O}}{2\cancel{\text{ L of \ce{H2}}}}=3\text{ L of }\ce{H2O}.
\end{equation*}
Overall, if we mix three litters of hydrogen we obtain 3L of water.
In case we know the litters of any of the reactants and we need to calculate the moles of product, then we have to add an extra step to transform litters into moles.


\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Hydrogen gas reacts with oxygen gas to produce water vapor according to the following equation:
\begin{center}\ce{  2H2(g)  + $\underset{\text{\large 2L}}{\ce{O2(g)   }}$  -> $\underset{\text{\large x mol}}{\ce{2H2O(g)}}$  } \end{center}
Calculate the number of moles of water produced from 2L of oxygen at STP conditions.
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We will solve the problem in a single line, first relating the liters of oxygen and litters of water produced and finally converting litters of water into moles of water using the molar volume. Remember when there are gases in the reaction, the stoichiometric coefficients can be interpreted in terms of liters:
\begin{equation*}
x=2L\cancel{\text{ L of }\ce{O2}} \times \dfrac{\cancel{\text{2 L of }\ce{H2O}}}{2\cancel{\text{ L of \ce{O2}}}} \times   \dfrac{\text{1 mol of }\ce{H2O}}{22.4 \cancel{\text{L of \ce{H2O}}}}      =0.178\text{ mol of }\ce{H2O}.
\end{equation*}
We have that two liters of oxygen produce four liters of water. At the same time, 22.4L of water--or any other gas--is 1 moles of that gas. So four L of water are 0.17moles of water.

\section{Real gases and the kinetic molecular theory of gases }
Until now we have discusses ideal gases. Ideal gases represent very diluted gases in which the gas particles do not see each other, as they are apart. The particles of an ideal gas are very minute without a volume. The collisions between the particles and the walls of the container are elastic--this means the gas molecules do not loose any energy. As you can imagine, no gas is an ideal gas, as this is just an ideal model. This section will cover the properties of real gases, in which the gas particles interact among themselves. We will also discuss the kinetic molecular theory with a particular emphasis on particle average velocity--this is technically called root mean square velocity, $v_{RMS}$. 
\sloppy 
\begin{description}
\item[\docfilehook{Van der Waals equation for real gases}{}] 
When we take into account the fact that the particles of a gas interact with each other the formula of the ideal gases do not work anymore. Instead, we can use the Van der Waals equation for real gases that functions in a very similar way.
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\boxed{  P=\frac{nRT}{V-nb}-\frac{n^2a}{V^2}} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Van der Waals equation}}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P$   is the pressure of the gas in atm
\item $V$    is the volume of the gas in L 
 \item $n$   is the number of moles of the gas
\item $T$   is the temperature of the gas in K
\item $R$   is the constant of the gas $0.082\frac{\text{atm}\cdot \text{L}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{K}}$
\item $a$ and $b$   are the Van der Waals constants in units of $atm\cdot L^2\cdot mol^{-2}$ and $L\cdot mol$
\end{where}


\item[\docfilehook{Van der Waals constants}{}] 
The Van der Waals constants $a$ and $b$ represent the degree of interaction between the molecules of a gas. The larger these values the more interactions exists between the gas particles. For example, for \ce{He} we have $a=$ 0.0341$ atm\cdot L^2\cdot mol^{-2}$ and $b=$ 0.0237$L\cdot mol$, whereas for \ce{H2O} we have $a=$ 5.46$ atm\cdot L^2\cdot mol^{-2}$ and $b=$ 0.0305$L\cdot mol$. Comparing the values of $a$ for both gases--or the values of $b$--we can conclude that the interaction between the particles of \ce{He} are very weak but the interactions between the particles of \ce{H2O} are stronger.

\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Calculate the pressure of 0.2 moles of water vapor at 500K and 6 atm occupying a volume of 0.1L, using: (a) the ideal gas formula and (b) the van der Waals formula $a=$ 5.46$ atm\cdot L^2\cdot mol^{-2}$ and $b=$ 0.0305$L\cdot mol$.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We will use the ideal gas formula first, given the number of moles ($n$=0.2 mol), temperature ($T$=500K), pressure ($p$=6 atm) and the volume ($V$=0.1L).
\begin{equation*}
P=\frac{nRT}{V}=\frac{0.2\times 0.083\times 500}{0.1}=82atm   
\end{equation*}
Now, using the van der Waals formula:
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
P=\frac{nRT}{V-nb}-\frac{n^2a}{V^2}= \frac{0.2\times 0.083\times 500}{0.1-0.2\times 0.0305}-\frac{0.2^2\times 5.46}{0.1^2}=65atm 
\end{split}\end{equation*}
Both values are very different and this is consistent with the fact that water vapor does not behave as an ideal gas.

\caption{The particles of a gas move fast.}
\end{marginfigure}%%%%%%%MARGIN FIGURE
The kinetic theory of gases is a model that explain the properties of gases. This theory envisions a gas in the form of a set of moving particles. Some of the ideas behind this model are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  The particles of a gas are in constant motion and move very fast.
\item On its movement, gas particles collide with each other changing paths, and collide with the walls of its container exerting pressure.
\item  Gas particles are far apart from each other, barely interacting.
\item The average kinetic energy of the particles of a gas (this is the energy of the particles due to movement) is proportional to the temperature of the gas.
\end{itemize}
By means of the kinetic theory we can rationalize the different properties of a gas. As the particles of a gas are in constant motion and apart from each other they fill and occupy the same volume of its container. The temperature of a gas is related to its kinetic energy, that is, the average speed of the gas particles. Also, as the gas particles collide with the container's wall, they exert pressure. The kinetic theory of gases explain for example how room fresheners work. As you spray the room, the molecules of the perfume in a gas state move fast and occupy the room.
The kinetic molecular theory of the gases gives a molecular-based description of the temperature of a gas--among other properties. The ideal gas law is an experimental law; this means is a law that comes from measuring and carrying experiments. However, this law does not provide any reasons behind the behavior of gases, ideal or real. The kinetic molecular theory provides a molecular description of temperature. In particular one of the outcomes of this theory is that the average velocity of a gas particle depends on the square root of the temperature of the gas. More precisely, the way this theory describe velocity is in the form of a \emph{root mean square velocity} $v_{RMS}$, that is, as an average of the velocity of each particle. The formula that connects the the root mean square velocity with temperature is:

\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\boxed{  v_{RMS}=\sqrt{   \frac{3000RT}{MW} }   } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Van der Waals equation}}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $MW$   is the molecular weight of the gas in $g\cdot mol^{-1}$
\item $T$   is the temperature of the gas in K
\item $R$   is the constant of the gas in energy units 8.314 $J\cdot K^{-1}\cdot mole^{-1} $
\item $v_{RMS}$ is the root mean square velocity in $m/s$
\end{where}
It is important to notice that the root mean square velocity depends on temperature--the more temperature the more velocity-- and is inverssely proportional to the molecular weight of the gas--the heavier the mass the lower velocity.


\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Order the following molecules in increasing order of root mean square velocity: \ce{Ne}, \ce{CO2} and \ce{H2O}.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Root mean square velocity is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the gas; hence, the larger the mass the lower velocity. If we compare the molecular weight of the gases: \ce{Ne}(MW=20$g\cdot mol^{-1}$), \ce{CO2}(MW=44$g\cdot mol^{-1}$) and \ce{H2O}(MW=18$g\cdot mol^{-1}$). The root mean square velocity of water is the largest and the root mean square velocity of carbon dioxide is the smallest.
