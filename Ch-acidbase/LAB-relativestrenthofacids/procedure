\begin{steps}

	\newstep[] Obtain 5 jumbo test tubes and a rack. Clean the test tubes and let them drain upside down in the rack.
	\newstep[] Obtain a 100 mL beaker with plenty of distilled water and transfer 4.0 mL in a graduated cylinder.
	\newstep[] Label one test tube with the letter R, and pour the 4.0 mL of distilled water into it. This test tube will be used as a volume reference for the following test tubes.
	\newstep[] In a 50 mL beaker get 40 mL of one of the following list of solutions (you will use the others further in the experiment). These solutions are going to be referred to here as the acid or base solutions.

\begin{multicols}{4}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 0.1 M \ce{H3PO4}
\item 0.1 M \ce{CH3COOH}
\item 0.1 M \ce{NaH2PO4}
\item 0.1 M \ce{Zn(NO3)2}
\item 0.1 M \ce{NH4NO3}
\item Distilled water
\item Tap water
\item Unknown solution
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

	\newstep[] Obtain a 250 mL beaker for waste, a medicine dropper or a plastic pipette 
	\newstep[] Label the rest of the test tubes from 1 to 4. Use test tube R as a reference for the volume to add in the following test tubes. Rinse the dropper with the distilled water (discarding it in the waste beaker) between different solutions. Add 4.0 mL of the solution chosen to each test tube.
	\newstep[] Add two drops of Thymol Blue to test tube 1. Using the color table provided in the background section, indicate the PH range of the solution.
	\newstep[] Add two drops of Methyl Orange to test tube 2. Using the color table provided in the background section, indicate the PH range of the solution.
	\newstep[] Add two drops of Methyl Red to test tube 3. Using the color table provided in the background section, indicate the PH range of the solution.
	\newstep[] Add two drops of Bromothymol Blue to test tube 4. Using the color table provided in the background section, indicate the PH range of the solution.
	\newstep[] Record the colors on the results page.
	\newstep[] Reserve the acid or base solution for Parts B and C. Set the beaker on a paper towel and label it.
	\newstep[] Discard the solutions tested with the indicator and clean the test tubes.
	\newstep[] Repeat steps 4 to 12 for another acid or base solution from the list given in Step 4. Make sure to rinse the dropper.
 
 

\subsection*{Part B. Determining pH using pH-paper.}

	\newstep[] Obtain a stirring rod and the universal indicator paper. Be careful not to contaminate the paper with dirty gloves or bare hands. Always set the (small) pieces of paper on a clean paper towel.
	\newstep[] Rinse the stirring rod with the wash bottle over the waste beaker. Rinse thoroughly between different solutions.
	\newstep[] Immerse the tip of the stirring rod in one solution and touch a piece of pH paper with the rod.
	\newstep[] Match the color of the drop on the paper with the color chart on the plastic case. Record the pH value in the results section.
	\newstep[] Repeat the same process; rinsing, dipping, and touching, for the rest of the solutions.
	\newstep[] Reserve the solutions in the beakers for part C.
		
\subsection*{Part C. Determining pH using a pH-meter.}

	\newstep[] Install the pH meter. The probe of the instrument is immersed in a clean solution that must be kept aside until the end of the experiment.
        \newstep[] Cleaning and measuring. It is very important to follow the cleaning steps before each measurement. You will need a 100 mL beaker labeled waste a wash bottle and a 100 mL beaker with distilled water.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rinse the probe using the wash bottle over the waste beaker.
\item Dip the probe 3-4 times into the 250 mL beaker with clean distilled water.
\item Dip the probe into the solution to be measured. Use a 50 mL beaker with at least 25 mL of solution.
\item Repeat cleaning steps 1 and 2.
\end{enumerate}
	\newstep[] Following the procedure outlined in the step above, measure the eight solutions.
	\newstep[] Record all the values.
