There are five different factors that contribute to the acidity of a chemical. First, the larger the electronegativity of the atom directly connected to hydrogen the stronger acidity. Second, the heavier the atom connected to hydrogen the stronger acidity. Third, the larger the electronegativity of an atom secondarily connected to a hydrogen the stronger acidity. Fourth, the larger the number of electronegative atoms indirectly connected to hydrogen the stronger acidity. Fifth, a possible stabilization of the corresponding anion generated by the dissociation of an acid increases acidity strength.
