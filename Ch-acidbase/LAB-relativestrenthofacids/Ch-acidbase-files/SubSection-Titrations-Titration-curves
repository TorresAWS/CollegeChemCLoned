A titration plot or PH curve represents the change on the PH during a titration as the volume of titrant increases. In the vertical axis it represents PH whereas in the horizontal axis it resents volume. Titration curves looks slightly different depending on nature of the chemical to be titrated. When titrating a strong acid, the curve starts at an acidic PH and near the endpoint PH rises sharply until reaching a plateau at a basic PH. The PH at the endpoint is neutral. When titrating a strong base, the curve starts at a basic PH and near the endpoint PH decreases sharply until reaching a plateau at a acidic PH. The PH at the endpoint is also neutral. 
When titrating a weak acid, the curve starts at an acidic PH and near the endpoint PH rises smoothly and not sharply until reaching a plateau at a basic PH. The PH at the endpoint is basic and the difference between the initial and final plateaus is small. Finally, when titrating a weak base, the curve starts at a basic PH and near the endpoint PH  decreases smoothly and not sharply until reaching a plateau at an acidic PH. The PH at the endpoint is basic and the difference between the initial and final plateaus is small. The main difference between acid and base titration curves is the starting PH, whereas the difference between strong and weak titration curves is the PH at the equivalency point, being basic for weak acids and acidic for weak bases.
For weak acids and base, the plateaus are called buffer areas, and in this PH range both the acid and conjugate base coexist. At the same time, and also for weak electrolytes, the PH in the half-point corresponds to the $pK$ value of the acid or base.
