We spoke at this point about the idea behind titrations, its most important points, and how to graphically represent the PH changes that happen. Now we will focus on calculating the PH value at different points along a titration. The formula involved behind titration can be complex and often involves quadratic formulas. In particular, the formulas to be used depends on the nature of the titrate and the titrant.
