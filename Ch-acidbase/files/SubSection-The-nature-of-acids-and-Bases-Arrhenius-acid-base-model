In general terms, we can identify some acids and bases by inspecting its formula. Svante Arrhenius claimed around 1884 that acids are acidic because contain hydrogen in their structure and when dissolved in water they produce \emph{protons}: \ce{H^+}, also called hydronium ion written as \ce{H3O^+}. Let us consider these chemicals: \ce{HF}, \ce{H2SO4} and \ce{HNO3}. All these chemicals, named hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid, are Arrhenius acidic. The reaction below described the process of dissociation of hydrogen chloride to produce chloride and a proton:
\begin{center}\ce{HCl_{(g)}  -> Cl^-_{(aq)} + H^+_{(aq)}}\hfill (an acid)\end{center}
Based on the acid dissociation reaction above, we say chloride is the result of deprotonating hydrochloric acid. In other words, chloride is deprotonated.
Based on this dissociation reaction that happens in water, we can say hydrogen chloride also known as hydrochloric acid is an Arrhenius acid, as it produces protons in water. We have that acids are classified as monoprotic, diprotic, and polyprotic. Monoprotic acids have only one acidic \ce{H} on their molecule (e.g. \ce{HNO3}), whereas diprotic acids have two (e.g. \ce{H2NO4}) and polyprotic acids have more than two (e.g. \ce{H3PO4}). 
 Differently, bases are basic because when dissolved in water they produce \emph{hydroxyls}: \ce{OH^-}. Hydroxides are Arrhenius bases and for example, \ce{NaOH} and \ce{Ca(OH)2}, named sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, are well-known bases. Let us address now the dissociation of sodium hydroxide in water:
\begin{center}\ce{NaOH_{(s)}   -> Na^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)}}\hfill (a base)\end{center}
This chemical is an Arrhenius base as it produces hydroxyls. 
Therefore, Arrhenius acids and bases produce protons and hydroxyls in water, respectively. However, the Arrhenius model does not explain why chemicals unsolved in water can also be acidic or even why chemicals such as \ce{NH3}--a molecule without OH on its structure--can be basic.
