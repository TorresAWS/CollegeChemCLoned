In summary, the Arrhenius definition is based on what is on a solution, whereas the Br\"{o}nsted-Lowry definition is based on giving and receiving protons. Finally, the Lewis definition is based on giving and receiving lone pairs. All these definitions are complementary and all Arrhenius acids are Br\"{o}nsted-Lowry as well as Lewis acids.
