In summary, the Arrhenius definition is based on what is on a solution, whereas the Br\"{o}nsted-Lowry definition is based on giving and receiving protons (see Table \ref{tab:Table-Acid-models}). Finally, the Lewis definition is based on giving and receiving lone pairs. All these definitions are complementary and all Arrhenius acids are Br\"{o}nsted-Lowry as well as Lewis acids.
