Acids and bases have very different properties. Acids are acidic, and this is characterized by a sour taste and often they sting to the touch. Bases are basic and that means they have a bitter--chalky--taste and they feel soapy--slippery--to the touch.
Acids are extensively used in the food and perfume industry. For example, vinegar--a liquid solution of acetic acid--is used in pickles and food preparations. On the other hand, lemon and orange juice containing citric acid is used in the preparation of effervescent salts and as a food preservative. Acids are also used in the production of batteries. Car batteries contain corrosive sulphuric acid. Bases are extensively used in manufacturing. Sodium hydroxide is used in the manufacture of soap, medicines, and even paper. Calcium hydroxide--also known as slaked lime--is used to neutralize the acid in water supplies or as an antidote for food poisoning. Calcium hydroxide is also used in the construction industry, mixed with sand and water to make mortar. Potassium hydroxide (\ce{KOH}) is also used in alkali batteries. Finally, ammonia is an extensively used cleaning product, also used to remove ink spots from clothes or grease from window-panes.\\
In the following, we will introduce the three different models used to describe acids and bases.
