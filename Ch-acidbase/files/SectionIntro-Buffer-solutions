We have previously addressed the properties of acids and bases. Buffers are specific solutions able to accommodate acids or bases without changing their PH. Buffers play a key role for example in our blood where a buffer system absorbs small quantities of acids and bases produced during biological reactions while keeping its PH constant. This section covers the properties of buffers. You will learn what are buffer, what are they made of. You will also learn how to compute the PH of a buffer system and the PH of a buffer after an acid or a base it is been added.
