Water is a weak electrolyte. The dissociation equilibrium of water is listed below:
\begin{center}\ce{$\textcolor{red}{\underset{\text{Acid}}{\ce{H2O_{(l)}}}}$ + $\textcolor{blue}{\underset{\text{Base}}{\ce{H2O_{(l)}}}}$  <=> $\textcolor{red}{\underset{\text{Conjugate Base}}{\ce{OH^-_{(aq)}}}}$ + $\textcolor{blue}{\underset{\text{Conjugate Acid}}{\ce{H3O^+_{(aq)}}}}$}\hfill $K_w$\end{center}
This chemical equilibrium representing the dissociation of water is called the autoprotolysis of water. We have that water, as well as many other chemicals, that can act as a base or an acid, hence giving and receiving protons. We call these types of chemicals \emph{amphiprotic}. Other examples of amphiprotic chemicals are \ce{HCO3^-} or \ce{HSO4^-}. The dissociation constant of water is called the ion-product of water $K_w$:
\begin{center}\ce{H2O_{(l)} <=>H^+_{(aq)}  +OH^{-}_{(aq)} } \hspace{1cm} $\big[ \ce{H^+} \big] \cdot \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]=1.0\cdot 10^{-14}$\end{center}
$K_w$ is a constant that only depends on the temperature of the water being $1.0\cdot 10^{-14}$ at 25$^\circ$C. The ion product of water established a relationship between protons and hydroxyls in solution:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \big[ \ce{H^+} \big] \cdot \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]=1.0\cdot 10^{-14}    }\label{\chapterlabel:equation2}
\end{equation}
