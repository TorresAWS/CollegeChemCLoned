Let's imagine we need to obtain the roots of a quadratic formula of the form:
\begin{center}  ax$^2$+bx+c=0 \end{center}
Here, those roots would be called $x_1$ and $x_2$. There are numerous ways to solve quadratic formulas. First, you can solve quadratic equations by simply applying the formula that gives you the roots
     \[ x_1 = \dfrac{- b+\sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}  \;\;\text{and}\;\; x_2 = \dfrac{- b-\sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a} \]
Secondly, if you have access to the internet, you can also use web apps that give you the roots right away without having to do any calculations. 
For example, \faInternetExplorer \href{https://www.mathsisfun.com/quadratic-equation-solver.html}{\emph{ quadratic equation solver link}}.
Finally, with a graphing calculator you can normally get the roots. This section addresses the use of the calculator to solve quadratic equations.
