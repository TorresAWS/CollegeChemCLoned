Our body needs oxygen to function properly. When you inhale, you introduce oxygen into the lungs. When you exhale, you release carbon dioxide, which is a waste product. Normally, the respiratory system keeps these two gases in balance. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when you breathe too fast or too deep. This hyperventilation--also known as over-breathing--causes carbon dioxide levels to drop too low. This means there is not enough \ce{CO2} in the blood and that causes the PH to increase becoming too alkaline. Treating the condition is a matter of raising carbon dioxide levels in the blood. You can do this by breathing from a plastic bag. Respiratory acidosis occurs when too much \ce{CO2} builds up in the body. Normally, the lungs remove \ce{CO2} while you breathe. However, sometimes your body is unable to get rid of enough \ce{CO2}. Treatments for this condition are usually designed to help your lungs. For example, you may be given drugs to dilate your airway. You might also be given oxygen or a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. The CPAP device can help you breathe if you have an obstructed airway or muscle weakness.
