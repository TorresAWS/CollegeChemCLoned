Oxides can be acidic, basic, or amphoteric. On one hand, acidic oxides react with water (or a base) forming its conjugate base. They tend to be covalent oxides, resulting from the combination of a nonmetal and oxygen. Example of acidic oxides \ce{CO2}, \ce{NO2} or \ce{SO2}. For example, \ce{CO2} can react with water forming carbonic acid:
\begin{center}\ce{CO2_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)} -> H2CO3_{(aq)}}\end{center}
At the same time
\begin{center}\ce{SO2_{(g)} + 2NaOH_{(aq)} -> Na2SO3_{(aq)}  + H2O_{(l)}}\end{center}
On the other hand, basic oxides react with water of acids to form a conjugate acid. They tend to be ionic compounds with metals from the first and second group. Examples are \ce{MgO},\ce{K2O} or \ce{CaO}. We have that calcium oxide reacts with water forming calcium hydroxyde:
\begin{center}\ce{CaO_{(s)} + H2O_{(l)} -> Ca(OH)2_{(aq)}  }\end{center}
Calcium hydroxide is also known as slaked lime. This hydroxide is used for example in the scrubbing of stack gases from the exhaust of power plants and factories. When this compound reacts with sulfur trioxide the following set of reactions happen:
\begin{center}\ce{SO2_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)} <=> H2SO3_{(aq)}}\\
\ce{Ca(OH)2_{(g)} + H2SO3_{(aq)} <=> CaSO3_{(s)} + 2H2O_{(l)}}
   \end{center}
Calcium oxide is also used in combination with soda ash (\ce{Na2CO3}) in the softening go water involving the removal of calcium and magnesium ions in solutions. These ions hinder the action of detergents.
Finally, amphoteric oxides can act as a basic or acidic oxyde. We call this \emph{amphoterism} and these oxides are \emph{amphoteric}. They tend to be oxides containing elements on the line between metals and nonmetals (Be, Al, Ga, Ge, As, In, Sn, Sb, Pb and Bi). Examples of amphoteric oxides are: \ce{Al2O3}  or  \ce{BeO}.
