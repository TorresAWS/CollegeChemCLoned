Let us consider an acid such as \ce{HCl}. We know acids produce protons (\ce{H^+} or \ce{H3O^+}) so we can express the acid dissociation as:
\begin{center}\ce{HCl_{(g)} ->[H2O] H^{+}_{(aq)} + Cl^{-}_{(aq)}}\end{center}
We indicate water on top of the arrow to represent that the dissociation process happens in water. There is an alternative way to represent this process by including explicitly water:
\begin{center}\ce{HCl_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)}	-> H3O^{+}_{(aq)} + Cl^{-}_{(aq)}}\end{center}
This way we explicitly represent the role of water as a proton receiver. Ultimately, both ways are correct and for some chemicals (e.g. \ce{NH3}) it is more convenient to use the role of water whereas for others it makes no difference.
In the following, we present more examples. For the case of \ce{HNO3}, nitric acid, we have:
\begin{center}\ce{HNO3(l) ->[H2O] H^+_{(aq)} + NO3^-_{(aq)}}\end{center}
that means once dissolved in water, nitric acid gives a proton and forms a nitrate \ce{NO3^-} cation. Some other acids, such as \ce{H2SO4} are diprotic, as they have two protons and hence they can lose both while reacting with water:
\begin{center}\ce{H2SO4(l) ->[H2O] 2H^+_{(aq)} +SO4^{2-}_{(aq)}}\end{center}
Bases produce hydroxyls (\ce{OH^-}) and an example of a base dissociation would be:
\begin{center}\ce{NaOH(s) ->[H2O] Na^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)}}\end{center}
