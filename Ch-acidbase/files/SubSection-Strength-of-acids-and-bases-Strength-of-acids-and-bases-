How do we quantify the strength of an acid or base? Weak acids dissociate partially in the water, and the dissociation is equilibrated. This means that in the same container, the molecular form of the acid coexists with its ionic-conjugate form. For this reason, we can employ an equilibrium constant called acidity constant $K_a$ to characterize the degree of dissociation. The larger $K_a$ the stronger the acid and hence the more protons will be produced in the solution. 
Let's consider the case of \ce{HF}. We have that the expression of the acidity constant will be:
\begin{center}\ce{HF_{(aq)}  <=>[H2O] H^+_{(aq)}  +F^{-}_{(aq)} } \hspace{1cm} $K_a=\frac{\big[ \ce{H^+} \big] \cdot \big[ \ce{F^-} \big]} {\big[ \ce{HF} \big] }$\end{center}
If we compare the acidity constant of two different acids, for example, hydrofluoric acid and hypochlorous acid 
\begin{center}\ce{HF_{(aq)}  <=>[H2O] H^+_{(aq)}  +F^{-}_{(aq)} } \hspace{1cm} $K_a=6.30\times 10^{-4}$\end{center}
\begin{center}\ce{HClO_{(l)}  <=>[H2O] H^+_{(aq)}  +ClO^{-}_{(aq)} } \hspace{1cm} $K_a=4.00\times 10^{-8}$\end{center}
we can conclude that \ce{HF} is stronger than \ce{HClO} as its acidity constant is larger.
Table \ref{tab:Table-Acidity-constants} reports acidity constants for several acids and bases.
