Litmus paper is an indicator heavily used for quick PH testing in labs. It contains a mixture of dyes that were extracted originally from lichens. There are two main types of litmus paper, red and blue litmus. Light blue litmus paper turns red when the medium is acidic, whereas red litmus paper turns blue in basic mediums. By wetting a piece of litmus paper one can also test for the acidity of gases, for example, ammonia vapor would turn blue on a piece of wet red litmus paper.
