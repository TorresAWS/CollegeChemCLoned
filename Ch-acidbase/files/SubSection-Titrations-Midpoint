The PH at the midpoint depends on the type of acid or base that is being titrated. For strong electrolytes, the PH at the midpoint will be given by the molarity of the initial solution. For example, when titrating a 0.1M HCl solution with 0.1M NaOH, the PH at the midpoint will be close to 1. Differently, the PH at the midpoint for weak electrolytes is given by the acidity or basicity constant of the acid. Specifically, it corresponds to the $PK$ of the acid or base. For example, when titrating a 0.1M HAc (acetic acid, $K_a=1.8 \times 10^{-5}$) solution with 0.1M NaOH, the PH at the midpoint will be close to 4.7.
