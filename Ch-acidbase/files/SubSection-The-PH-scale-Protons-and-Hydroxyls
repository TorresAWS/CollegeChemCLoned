Acids and bases exist in solution with water. That means that as they produce protons or hydroxyls water receives these ions as it ionizes as well. Hence, the concentration of protons and hydroxyls in the solution is not independent. Indeed, the ion-product of water relates the concentration of protons ($\big[ \ce{H^+}\big]$) and the concentration of hydroxyls ($\big[ \ce{OH^-}\big]$):
 \begin{equation*}
 \big[ \ce{H^+} \big] \cdot \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]=1.0\times 10^{-14}
 \end{equation*}

Water is neutral, which means that the concentration of protons ($\big[ \ce{H^+}\big]$) and the concentration of hydroxyls ($\big[ \ce{OH^-}\big]$) and both equal to $1.0\cdot 10^{-7}$M. When we dissolve an acid or a base into the water, $\big[ \ce{OH^-}\big]$ and $\big[ \ce{H^+}\big]$ change drastically. When dissolving an acid, $\big[ \ce{H^+}\big]$ increases as acids produce protons, while $\big[ \ce{OH^-}\big]$ decreases. Differently, when dissolving a base,  $\big[ \ce{OH^-}\big]$ increases, as bases produce hydroxyls, while $\big[ \ce{H^+}\big]$ decreases.
