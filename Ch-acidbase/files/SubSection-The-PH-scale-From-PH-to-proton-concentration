At this point, we know that the PH quantifies the proton concentration of a solution. So given $\big[\ce{H^+}\big]$ we can calculate PH using the logarithm with the opposite sign. But what if we know the PH and we want to calculate the corresponding proton concentration? We can do this by using the formula:
 \begin{equation}
\boxed{\big[\ce{H^+}\big]=\textrm{\Large 10}^{-PH} }\label{\chapterlabel:equation6}
\end{equation}
To use the previous formula you need to use the power key in your calculator. For example, if the PH is 3.3 and we need to calculate the proton concentration you will need to type: 10\keystroke{\large $\wedge$}\keystroke{\large $-$}3.3, and the result is $5.0\cdot 10^{-4}$M. Mind that: (a) in some calculators, sometimes the power key looks like \keystroke{\large $10^{x}$}; (b) you need to use the negative key and not the minus key. The minus sign is used for substations, the negative key is used for numbers.
An equivalent relation exists between the concentration of hydroxyls and the POH:
 \begin{equation}
\boxed{\big[\ce{OH^-}\big]=\textrm{\Large 10}^{-POH} }\label{\chapterlabel:equation7}
\end{equation}
The diagram in Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-PH-POH-formulas} displays some of the most important equations involved in this section:
