 At this point we are familiar with acids and bases. We have that acids have sour taste and produce protons in water. Differently bases feel soupy to the touch and produce hydroxyls. Both acids and bases react together giving conjugate species.  This section covers the strength of acid and bases. Some acids are weak acid whether other are stronger. The same idea can be applied to bases. We will also lear how to quantify the strength of an acid or base and compare the acidic or basic character of a chemical.
