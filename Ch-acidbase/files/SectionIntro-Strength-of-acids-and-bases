 At this point, we are familiar with acids and bases. Acids have a sour taste and produce protons in water. Differently, bases feel soupy to the touch and produce hydroxyls. Both acids and bases react together giving conjugate species.  This section gains further insight into the strength of acids and bases. Some acids are weaker while others are stronger. The same idea can be applied to bases. Here we will also learn how to quantify the strength of an acid or base and how to compare the acidic or basic character of a chemical.
