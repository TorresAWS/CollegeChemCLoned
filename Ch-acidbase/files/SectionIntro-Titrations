Titration is a chemical technique used to calculate the unknown molarity of an acid or base. It is based on the principle that acids neutralize bases and we can figure out the molarity of the unknown chemical (the titrate) by knowing the reacting amounts. A titration uses chemical equipment: a burette, Erlenmeyer, and an indicator. The unknown chemical is called the titrate and the known chemical is called the titrant. The goal of a titration is to calculate the volume of titrant needed to neutralize the titrate. We reach the endpoint of a titration when the titrant and titrate completely neutralize. At the end point, the mixture of titrant and titrate has a specific PH. Even though the chemical procedure in the lab is similar when titrating strong or weak acids or bases, the calculations needed to calculate the PH at the endpoint differ. This section will cover the principles and calculations involved in titrations.
