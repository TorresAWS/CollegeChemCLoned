In a very similar way, bases also have what we call base dissociation constants: $K_b$. The bigger this value the stronger the base and the more hydroxyls will be produced. For the case of ammonia:
\begin{center}\ce{NH3_{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)} <=>NH4^+_{(aq)}  +OH^{-}_{(aq)} } \hspace{1cm} $K_b=\frac{\big[ \ce{NH4^+} \big] \cdot \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]} {\big[ \ce{NH3} \big] }$\end{center}
remember liquid water can not be part of an equilibrium constant. 
If we compare the basicity constant of two different bases, for example, ammonia and hydrazine 
\begin{center}\ce{NH3_{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)} <=>NH4^+_{(aq)}  +OH^{-}_{(aq)} }\hspace{1cm} $K_b=1.80\times 10^{-5}$\end{center}
\begin{center}\ce{N2H4_{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)} <=>N2H5^+_{(aq)}  +OH^{-}_{(aq)} } \hspace{1cm} $K_b=1.30\times 10^{-6}$\end{center}
we can conclude that \ce{NH3} is stronger than \ce{N2H4} as its basicity constant is larger.
