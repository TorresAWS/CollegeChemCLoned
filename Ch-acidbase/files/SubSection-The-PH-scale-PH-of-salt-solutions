As well as hydracids or hydroxides, salts can exhibit acid or base character. For example, ammonium chloride (\ce{NH4Cl}) is an acidic salt, as ammonium is the conjugate acid of a weak base, and therefore has moderately strong character. Differently, chloride is the conjugate base of a strong acid (HCl) and has a weak character. Let us calculate the PH of a 0.1-M \ce{NH4Cl} solution. As the salt is acidic, we will use Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation9} given that $c_a$=0.1M and $K_a=5.5\times 10^{-10}$ (mind for ammonia $K_b=1.8\times 10^{-5}$ and \ref{\chapterlabel:equation1} related $K_a$ and $K_b$):
\[ \big[ \ce{H^+} \big]^2 +5.5 \times 10^{-10}\cdot \big[ \ce{H^+} \big] -5.5 \times 10^{-11}=0 \]
Solving for $\big[ \ce{H^+} \big]$ we have that $\big[ \ce{H^+} \big]=7.4\times 10^{-6}$M and PH=5.13. As predicted, the PH of an ammonium chloride solution is acidic.
