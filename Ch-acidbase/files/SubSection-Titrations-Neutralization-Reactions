Titrations involve a neuralization reaction in which an acid neutralizes a base. Acids produce protons \ce{H^+} and bases hydroxyls \ce{OH^-} that neutralize each other forming water, \ce{H2O}. More importantly, they react in very specific ratios. Let us take a look at the reaction of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide to produce water and sodium chloride:
\begin{center}\ce{ HCl_{(aq)} + NaOH_{(aq)}    -> NaCl_{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)} } \hspace{1cm} \textcolor{red}{Neutralization Reaction}\end{center}
In this reaction, one mole of \ce{HCl} reacts with one mole of  \ce{NaOH}. The fact that one more reacts with one more can be used as a principle for acid-base titration. We will have to use the stoichiometry of the reaction to calculate the volume of titrant needed to neutralize the titrate. Imagine you have an unknown sample of HCl and you need to determine the amount of acid in the solution. If you know that this sample reacts with a specific amount of \ce{NaOH} as you know that they react in a one-2-one ratio then you would know the acidic content. This is the idea behind titration: a laboratory procedure in which an unknown sample is neutralized with a known solution. A chemical \emph{indicator}, which changes color depending on the acidity of the medium, is used to visually reveal the moment in which the acid and the base are completely neutralized. The point at which the indicator changes color is called the \emph{endpoint}. At the endpoint, the acid and the base are neutralized.
