In general terms, we can identify acids and bases based on its formula. Let us consider these chemicals: \ce{HF}, \ce{H2SO4} and \ce{HNO3}. All these named hydroflouric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid are acidic. Hydro acids, and oxyacids will certainly be acidic. Acids are classified as monoprotic, diprotic and polyprotic. Monoprotic acids have only one acidic \ce{H} on its molecule (e.g. \ce{HNO3}), whereas diprotic acids have two (e.g. \ce{H2NO4}) and polyprotic acids have more than two (e.g. \ce{H3PO4}).
Hydroxides are basic and for example, \ce{NaOH} and \ce{Ca(OH)2} named sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are well-known bases. At the same time, some covalent compounds such as ammonia (\ce{NH3}) are basic. However, not all covalent compounds containing hydrogen are basic and for example, \ce{CH4} is not basic at all. Finally, organic acids are acidic and organic amines tends to be basic. For example, acetic acid \ce{CH3COOH} is an acid and \ce{CH3NH2} is a base.
