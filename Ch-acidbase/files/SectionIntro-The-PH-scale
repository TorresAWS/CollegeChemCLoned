This section describes the PH scale that simply transforms a concentration value--oftentimes a very small number--into a simple round value. In short, the PH value tells you how many protons are there in a solution so that the larger PH the fewer protons are there in the solution. It also informs about the hydroxyl concentration, as protons and hydroxyls are connected using the dissociation equilibrium of water.
