The goal of this section is to quantify--calculate the value--the PH at the equivalency point when titrating an acid or a base with a strong chemical. For example, we will have a weak acid that will be titrated with a strong base and we will have to determine the PH at the equivalency point. There is a series of formulas to calculate the PH at the equivalency point.  The formulas are given in Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter} and the formula to use will depend on the nature of the substance to be titrated. If we titrate a strong acid or base, the formulas are relatively simple. Differently, if we titrate a weak acid or base, the formulas are quadratic equations. Also, independently of the nature of the titrate, there are certain concentrations $c_R$ and $c_F$ that appear in most of the formulas. In the following, we will address the meaning of these concentrations.
