A titration plot or PH curve represents the change in the PH during titration as the volume of the titrant increases. In the vertical axis, it represents PH, in the horizontal axis, it resents volume. The species present in the titrate change as the titration proceed. For example, in the case of the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, before it starts, the major species is solution is the weak acid \ce{HA}. When the titration proceeds and before reaching the endpoint, the major species in solution are the weak acid and the conjugate base (\ce{A^-} and \ce{HA}), as the titrant neutralizes some of the acids. At the endpoint, the major specie present is the conjugate base \ce{A^-}. After the endpoint, the PH is given by the excess of the titrant.
