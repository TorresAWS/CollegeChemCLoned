A titration plot or PH curve represents the change on the PH during a titration as the volume of titrant increases. In the vertical axis it represents PH whereas in the horizontal axis it resents volume. The species presente in the titrate change as the titration proceed. For example, for the case of the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, before it starts, the major scecie is solution is the weak acid \ce{HA}. When the titration proceeds and before reaching the endpoint, the major species in solution are the weak acid and the conjugate base (\ce{A^-} and \ce{HA}), as the titrant neutralizes some of the acid. At the end point, the major specie present is the conjugate base \ce{A^-}. After the endpoint, the PH is given by the excess of titrant.
