Oxoacids contain a central halogen atom bonded to one or more oxygen atoms as well as hydrogen. These acids normally have the following general structure: \ce{_n(O-)Cl-O-H}. For example, \ce{Cl-O-H} is called hypochlorous acid (\ce{HClO}), and \ce{_3(O-)Cl-O-H} is called perchloric acid (\ce{HClO4}).
We will first address the changes in acidity with the nature of the central halogen and then address the changes in acidity with the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
When comparing the acidity of hypochlorous acid, hypobromous acid, and hypoiodous acid, we find that 
\begin{center}$K_a$(\ce{HIO}) < $K_a$(\ce{HBrO})< $K_a$(\ce{HClO})  \end{center}
In other words, acidity increases from bottom to top across a group. That is the greater the electronegativity of the halogen the stronger the acid character. This trend is indeed opposite to the one found in binary acids. As the electronegativity of the halogen increases more electron density is withdrawn towards the \ce{X-O} bond and less electronic density is available for the \ce{O-H}. As a consequence, the \ce{O-H} bond becomes weaker due to the indirect changes of the \ce{O-X} bond as acidity increases. Hence, we have a new factor that controls acidity: the larger the electronegative of the central halogen in an oxoacid the stronger acidity (\emph{Acidity factor 3}). 
When comparing the acidity of hypochlorous acid, chlorous acid, chloric acid, and perchloric acid, we find that 
\begin{center}$K_a$(\ce{\ce{_1(O-)Cl-O-H}	}) < $K_a$(\ce{_2\ce{(O-)Cl-O-H}	})< $\ldots$  < $K_a$(\ce{	\ce{_4(O-)Cl-O-H}})\end{center}
In other words, acidity increases as the number of oxygen atoms connected to the central halogen increases. As the number of electronegative oxygen atoms connected to the central halogen atoms increases, more electron density will be withdrawn from the central Cl. This will also impact the oxygen connected to the acidic hydrogen weakening the \ce{O-H} bond and increasing acidity. The more oxygens are connected to the central halogen the stronger acidity (\emph{Acidity factor 4}). 
To summarize, two different factors impact the acid character of oxoacids: the electronegativity of the central halogen and the number of oxygens connected to the central halogen.
