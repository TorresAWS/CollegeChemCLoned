The second model describing acids and bases is the Br\"{o}nsted-Lowry model. This more advanced model claims acids are chemicals that give away protons (\ce{H^+}) whereas bases receive protons. Based on this mode, we can understand how acids can give away protons to water generating \ce{H3O^+} and bases such as ammonia can receive protons from water leaving \ce{OH^-} in solution:
\begin{center}\ce{NH3_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)}   <=> NH4^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)}}\end{center}
Still, this models does not explain what structural particularity makes ammonia behave as a base and carbon dioxide (with no hydrogen on its structure) an acid.
