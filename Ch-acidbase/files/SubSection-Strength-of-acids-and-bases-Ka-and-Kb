Acidity and basicity are related concepts. As such, there is a relationship between the constant of acidity and the constant of basicity of an acid or base given by:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ K_a\cdot K_b= 1.0\cdot 10^{-14}  }\label{\chapterlabel:equation1}
\end{equation}
This relationship implies that all acids and bases have a constant of acidity as well as basicity. For example, if the constant of acidity of a given acid is $1.5\times 10^{-5}$, the basicity constant of the same species would be $6.6\times 10^{-10}$. If $K_a$ is large and the acid is strong $K_b$ must be small and the basic character of a strong acid is very weak. Further in the chapert, you will find a table listing some acidity and basicity constants. In general, there are some simple rules that predict the acid-base character of an acid-conjugate base pair. Strong acids in general produce weak conjugate bases. For example, \ce{HCl} is a strong acid and its conjugate base (\ce{Cl^-}) is a weak base. Differently, \ce{HF} is a weak acid and its conjugate base (\ce{F^-}) is a moderately strong base. Also, if $pK_a$ is smaller than 7 we can consider that the chemical is more acidic than basic, and we call the chemical an acid. If $pK_a$ is larger than 7 (and therefore $pK_b$ is smaller than 7) we can consider that the chemical is more basic than acidic, and we call the chemical a base.
