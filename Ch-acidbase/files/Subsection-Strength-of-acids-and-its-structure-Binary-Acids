Binary acids result from the combination of an element (e.g. N, O, F) with hydrogen: \ce{NH3}, \ce{H2O}, \ce{HF}, \ce{HCl}, \ce{HBr}, and \ce{HI}. Mind that ammonia and even methane are indeed very weak acids. Here we will compare the acidity of well-known acids (e.g. \ce{HCl}) as well as other hydrogen-based chemicals (e.g. \ce{NH3}).
We find two different acidity trends across periods and groups of the periodic table. On one hand, we have that across a period from left to right acidity increases
\begin{center}$K_a$(\ce{NH3}) < $K_a$(\ce{H2O})< $K_a$(\ce{HF})	\end{center}
For this set of acids, the dominant contribution to acidity is the electronegativity character of the central atom: the larger the electronegativity of the central atom the larger the tendency of this atom to withdraw electron density from hydrogen and hence the bond becomes weaker (\emph{acidity factor 1}). The less electron density localized in the bond the larger acidity--the easier would be to break this bond.
On the other hand, across a group, acidity increases when going from \ce{HF} to \ce{HI}, that is from top to bottom. We have that across a group 
\begin{center}$K_a$(\ce{HF}) < $K_a$(\ce{HCl})< $K_a$(\ce{HBr})< $K_a$(\ce{HI})	\end{center}
This trend corresponds with an increase in the atomic weight of the central atom and an increase in the capacity of the corresponding anion to stabilize the negative charger. Acid dissociation necessarily implies the formation of an anion (e.g. \ce{Cl^-} or even \ce{NH2^-}). The more stable this anion the stronger its acidity. Heavier atoms are more capable to stabilize negative charges and hence they are more stable. Therefore, the larger the atomic weight of the central atom the stronger acidity (\emph{acidity factor 2}). 
At this point, we saw two different factors that contribute to acidity. These factors play a key role as well in other types of acids as we will see in the following.
