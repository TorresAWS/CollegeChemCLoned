Weak acids (and base) are indeed weak electrolytes, which means if we prepare a solution of a given concentration $c_a$ they will dissociate giving a proton concentration ($\big[ \ce{H^+} \big]$) less than $c_a$. We define the percent dissociation $\alpha$ of an acid (or base) as:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \alpha=\frac{\text{amount dissociated}}{\text{initial amount}}\times 100=\frac{\big[ \ce{H^+} \big]}{c_a}\times 100 }\label{\chapterlabel:equation11}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\big[ \ce{H^+} \big]$  is concentration of protons in equilibrium
 \item $c_a$   is the initial acid concentration
\end{where}
For example, a 0.2M HF solution has a proton concentration of 0.0076M. The percent dissociation of this acid at this concentration will be 3.8\%. The percent dissociation changes with the acid (or base) concentration and more concentrated acids have in general a larger proton concentration than diluted acids. However, the percent dissociation of more concentrated acids is smaller than the one of less concentrated acids. The diagram below displays this concept.
