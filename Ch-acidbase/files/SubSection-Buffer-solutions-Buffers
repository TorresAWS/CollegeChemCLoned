Buffers are solutions of an acid and a base. But not any kind of acid or base. Buffers are solutions of a weak acid with its conjugate base, or weak bases and its conjugate acid. For example, a mixture of 0.1M \ce{NH3} and 0.1M \ce{NH4Cl} is a buffer. You can find acidic or basic buffers. For example, the previous example was a basic buffer, whereas a mixture of 0.1M \ce{CH3COOH} and 0.1M \ce{NaCH3COO} is an acidic buffer. 
Acidic buffers contain a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Basic buffers contain a mixture of a weak base and its conjugate acid.
Buffer function thanks to the equilibrium that links the acid and base so that when small quantities of acid or base are added the conjugate species contra rest this external action keeping the PH constant. Still, buffers have a limit of action, and if large quantities of external acid or bases are added the buffer equilibrium can be broken and they lose their capacity to modulate the PH.
