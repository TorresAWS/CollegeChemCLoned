Acid-base indicators are water-soluble organic dyes that have a different color depending on PH. Indeed, indicators are weak acids that exist in a conjugate base form as well. Both the acid (the indicator form with the hydrogen attached) and the conjugate base have a different color due to differences in their electronic structure that transform into differences absorbing light. For example, phenolphthalein is a common acid-base indicator that is transparent when the PH is acidic and pink when the PH is basic. The equivalency point of a titration (when acid and base are neutralized) is not necessarily the end point (when the indicator changes color). However, if both points are close enough chemical indicators are an accurate way to visually locate the equivalency point during a titration.
As indicators are weak acids, each particular indicator is characterized by a constant of acidity referred to as $K_{In}$ so that
\begin{center}\ce{HIn_{(aq)}  <=>[H2O] H^+_{(aq)}  +In^{-}_{(aq)} } \hspace{1cm} $K_{In}=\frac{\big[ \ce{H^+} \big] \cdot \big[ \ce{In^-} \big]} {\big[ \ce{HIn} \big] }$\end{center}
The change in color is considered to happen when the difference between the acidic and basic form of the indicator is an order or magniture--ten times--different. This is the ten times rule. For this difference, we have that
\begin{center}$PH=PK_{In} \pm 1$\end{center}
We can always use a different value for the difference ($\Delta$) between the acid and basic form of an indicator so that the PH range will be given by
\begin{center}$PH=PK_{In} \pm log(\Delta)$\end{center}
This expression helps with the selection of the indicator for a given titration. For example, if we want to select an indicator that changes color when the difference between acid and base form is 5 times ($\Delta=5$), then the OH range would be: $PH=PK_{In} \pm 0.7$
