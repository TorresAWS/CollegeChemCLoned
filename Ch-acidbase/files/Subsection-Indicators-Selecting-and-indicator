A good indicator will turn into a different color within the transition between acid and basic PH during titration. For example, for the titration of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide, the PH changes from 5 before the equivalency point to 8 after. Any indicator with $PK_{In}$ between 5 and 8 would be able to accurately indicate the stoichiometric point. Examples are bromothymol blue, m-nitrophenol, and even phenolphthalein which transition color at 8. For the titration of a weak acid and a strong base, the selection of an indicator is more difficult as the difference between the acidic and basic plateaus during the titration is less pronounced. We must choose an indicator that changes color more closely to the endpoint.
