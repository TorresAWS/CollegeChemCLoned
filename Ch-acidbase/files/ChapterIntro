\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}A}{cids} and bases are part of our everyday life, from the vinegar in our salad to many of the cady our kids eat such as Sour Patch Kids. On one hand, vinegar tastes sour as it contains acetic acid. Sour Patch Kids, on the other hand, are coated in a combination of sugar and acids. Acids help us digest food and help bacteria produce yogurt or cottage cheese. Bases on the other hand are used in drain openers, oven cleaners, or the production of soap. This chapter covers the properties of acids and bases qualitatively and quantitatively. You will learn how to identify each of these chemicals and categorize them according to their strength. Yes! acids and bases are strong, and some of them can seriously hurt you. More importantly, this chapter introduces the idea of PH, which quantifies the acidity of a solution. The PH of an acid or base depends on its strength and here we will cover how to compute the PH of solutions of strong and weak acids and bases. Balancing PH is crucial for health. Finally, we will briefly cover the idea of a buffer that helps regulate the PH of solutions and titrations used to elucidate the molarity of an unknown acid or base.
