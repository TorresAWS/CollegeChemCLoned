In titrations, there is another important point called the mid-point. The mid-point is reached at half the equivalency point. For example, the end-point of the titration of 10 mL of 0.1M \ce{HCl} by 10 mL of 0.1M \ce{NaOH} happens when we add 10 mL of the base. The mid-point hence will happen when we add 5mL of the base. We have that the volumes of the end ($V_{EP}$) and the midpoint ($V_{MP}$) are related by the formula below:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{V_{MP}=\frac{V_{EP}}{2}  } 
\end{equation}
