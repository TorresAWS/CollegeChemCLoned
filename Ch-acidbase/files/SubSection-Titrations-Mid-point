In titrations, there is another important point called the mid-point. The mid-point is reached at half the equivalency point. For example, the end-point of the titration of 10 mL of 0.1M \ce{HCl} by 10 mL of 0.1M \ce{NaOH} happens when we add 10 mL of the base. The mid-point hence will happen when we add 5mL of the base. We have that the volumes of the end ($V_{EP}$) and the midpoint ($V_{MP}$) are related by the formula below:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{V_{MP}=\frac{V_{EP}}{2}  } 
\end{equation}

The midpoint is also used to compute the acidity or basicity constant of weak electrolytes. We have that if we titrate a weak acid, at the midpoint, the concentration of the acid and the conjugate base are the same at the midpoint. Hence, for a weak acid at the midpoint, we have:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{PH=PK_a \;\;\text{(at the midpoint)} } 
\end{equation}
There is an equivalent equation for the titration of a weak base at the midpoint, this time leading to $PK_b$. As you can see titration curves are also useful to understand the nature of acids or bases involved.
