Acids and bases are indeed electrolytes. Remember electrolytes can be weak or strong depending on the degree to which they dissociate. Strong acids are strong electrolytes that dissociate completely in water producing large quantities of protons \ce{H^+}. Strong bases are strong electrolytes that dissociate completely to produce this time large quantities of hydroxyls \ce{OH^-}. Weak acids or weak bases dissociate only partially and hence they produce fewer protons or hydroxyls. Examples of strong electrolytes are: \ce{HCl}, \ce{H2SO4} or \ce{HNO3}. As they dissociate completely we use a single arrow to indicate they are strong electrolytes:
\begin{center}\ce{HCl_{(l)} ->[H2O] H^+_{(aq)} +Cl^{-}_{(aq)}} \hspace{1cm} \textcolor{blue}{One arrow indicates strong acids or bases}\end{center}
Weak acids or bases that only dissociate partially are represented by a double arrow as the reaction is indeed an equilibrium. Examples of weak acids or bases are \ce{NH3} or  \ce{HF}. 
\begin{center}\ce{HF_{(l)} <=>[H2O] H^+_{(aq)} +F^{-}_{(aq)}} \hspace{1cm} \textcolor{blue}{A double arrow indicates weak acids or bases}\end{center}
