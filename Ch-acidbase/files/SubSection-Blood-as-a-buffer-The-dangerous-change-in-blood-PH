Most biological molecules are very sensitive to PH changes. Small deviations in PH can be dangerous or even fatal. If the blood PH falls below 7.34 it becomes more acidic causing a clinical condition called \emph{acidosis}. On the other hand, if the PH rises above 7.45, the blood becomes more basic causing a condition called \emph{alkalosis}. Changes in PH below 6.8 or above 8.0 can cause death.
