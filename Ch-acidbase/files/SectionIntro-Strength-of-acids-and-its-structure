Why are some acids stronger than others? There is not simple answer to this question. The strength of a given acid depends not only on its molecular structure but also on energetic and electronic arguments. In this section, we will explore the mechanisms responsible for acidity in three different families of chemicals: binary acids (e.g. \ce{HCl}), oxoacids (e.g. \ce{HClO}), and carboxylic acids (e.g. \ce{CH3COOH}).
