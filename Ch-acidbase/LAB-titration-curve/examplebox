\begin{example}{Example}

\begin{it} A solution of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a weak acid, is titrated using NaOH, a strong base. The pH is monitored during the titration using a pH-meter. The following plot is obtained:

Use the graphical method to identify the equivalence point for the titration, the volume of base added at the equivalence point, the midpoint, and the HCN $K_a$.

\begin{bf}Answer\end{bf}: The equivalence point is obtained from the graph. (1) Draw the lines for the 2 straight sectors. (2) Draw the equidistant line. (3) Identify the equivalence point were the equidistant line intercepts the curve. (4) Draw a vertical line to find the volume; 50.0 mL. (5) The half-way point would be: 50.0 mL/2 = 25.0 mL. (6) Draw a vertical line up to the curve. (7) From the curve draw an horizontal line to find the pH; 9.21. The $pK_a$ = 9.21 (7), and therefore $K_a$ = 10$^{-9.21}$ = 6.2 $\times$10$^{-10}$
