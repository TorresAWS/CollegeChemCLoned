\subsection*{Preparing the setup}


\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Obtain a 50 mL buret, rinse it with distilled water, and verify that it operates correctly (you should be able to add drops but also larger quantities).
	\newstep[] Obtain a hot plate with magnetic stirring, a magnetic stirring rod, a stand, two 150 mL beakers, and a pH meter.
	\newstep[] Arrange the setup so that the beaker is on the hot plate, the pH meter is to its left, with the probe inserted in one of the beakers, and the tip of the buret is also slightly inserted into the beaker. The number markings on the buret should be facing you, and the valve should be accessible and operative.
	\newstep[] Rinse the buret with a small amount of 0.1 M NaOH solution. Discard the rinsing liquid. Fill the buret with fresh NaOH solution. Your instructor will either give you an unknown or instruct you to use the already prepared NaOH solution. Discard the first 3-4 mL (the volume of solution in the tip of the buret used for the rinsing).

\subsection*{Preparing the KHP solution}
\begin{steps}
%	\newstep[] If you were given an unknown sample, this section is unnecessary. Just use two 50mL samples of the unknown to carry out the titration.
	\newstep[] Put one of the beakers on the scale and set it to zero (T/O). The beaker must be dry. Remove the beaker from the scale to add a small amount of KHP. You need an amount between 0.45 and 0.55 grams. Record the value with all the decimals.
	\newstep[] Obtain 50.0 mL of distilled water in a graduated cylinder.
	\newstep[] Carefully add the 50.0 mL of distilled water from the graduated cylinder into the beaker containing the KHP. 
	\newstep[] Prepare a second solution on the second beaker.




\end{steps}	

\subsection*{Measuring}
\begin{steps}
\newstep[]	Add the magnetic stirrer to one of the beakers, put the beaker on the hotplate, and set a gentle stirring speed. Do not start the heat on the plate! 		
\newstep[] Clean the pH-meter probe before immersing it in the KHP solution.
	\newstep[] Either you are given an unknown or you will use the NaOH already prepared from the lab. Read and record the initial pH before adding any NaOH.
	\newstep[] Start adding the titrant (the base). After every addition (see next step) record the \textbf{buret reading} (not the volume added) and the corresponding pH measurement.

	\newstep[] NaOH should be added initially in 1 mL increments, but at a certain moment, additions should be reduced to 0.2 mL portions. Mind that the pH will change very slowly at the beginning and the end of the titration. However, around the equivalence point, the pH will change extremely fast with small additions of the titrant. 
	\newstep[] Read the buret and record the volume with all the digits given by the buret plus the estimated digit.
	\newstep[]	Add the titrant in 1 mL portions making sure the buret readings are precise.


\newstep[] After every addition, estimate how much the pH changed from the previous pH measurement. If the pH has changed by less than 0.3 pH units, add 1 mL of titrant in the next step. If the pH has changed by 0.3 pH-units or more, begin adding the titrant in 0.2 mL portions.
   \newstep[]	When adding 0.2 mL portions, if the pH change starts to slow down and increases by less than 0.3 pH-units between measurements \textbf{for at least 3 measurements in a row}, then you can start adding 1 mL portions again.
	\newstep[] Stop the titration when the pH exceeds 11.5.
	\newstep[] Do a second titration trial. Clean and reuse the magnetic stirred; in the results section, plot by hand the titration plot.
