A 1mL sample of 2M \ce{NH3} (K$_b$=$1.80 \times 10^{-5}$) is titrated by 2 mL of a \ce{HCl} 1M solution. \begin{inparaenum}[(a)] 
\item indicate whether you are before, after or at the endpoint
\item indicate whether the titrate is an acid or a base, and a weak or a strong electrolyte
\item indicate the formula that would need to be used to calculate the PH
\item calculate the PH 
\end{inparaenum}
