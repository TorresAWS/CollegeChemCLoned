The following examples will cover titration in which the titrate is a weak electrolyte, acid or base. For these case, the corresponding PH formula involves a quadratic equation that will lead to the calculation to the concentration of protons or hydroxyles. Afterwards, the PH would need to be calculated using the regular logarithmic formulas (Equations \ref{\chapterlabel:equation3}-\ref{\chapterlabel:equation5})

\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
A 1mL sample of 2M acetic acid (\ce{CH3COOH}, $K_b=1.75 \times 10^{-5}$) is titrated by 0.66 mL of a \ce{NaOH} 3M solution. \begin{inparaenum}[(a)] 
\item indicate whether you are before, after or at the endpoint
\item indicate whether the titrate is an acid or a base, and a weak or a strong electrolyte
\item indicate the formula that would need to be used from Table \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}2} to calculate the PH 
\item calculate the PH
\end{inparaenum}
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We have that \ce{CH3COOH} is the titrant and \ce{NaOH} is the titrate. This is because the question indicates that you titrate \ce{CH3COOH} and therefore the chemical to be titrated is the titrant. The titrant is a weak acid. In order to find out whether we are before, at or after the endpoint, we will have to use \ref{\chapterlabel:equation13} and calculate the volume of titrant needed to neutralize the titrate. If the volume of titrant we have used is less than the endoint volume then we will be before the end point. If it is larger then we will be beyond the end point. We will be at the endpoint if the volume of titrant used is the same as the endpoint volume. We have that $c_a=$2M, $V_a=1$mL, and $n_{H}=$1. We also have that $c_b=$3M, and $n_{OH}=$1. We will calculate $V_b$ that fulfills \ref{\chapterlabel:equation13}:
\[  1\cdot 2\cdot 1=1\cdot 3\cdot V_b \]
Therefore, $V_b=$0.66mL. Therefore, we are at the endpoint and the PH is given by:
\[  \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]^2 +K_b\cdot \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big] -K_b\cdot c_f=0 \]
as we have that $K_a=1.75 \times 10^{-5}$ and therefore $K_a=1.33 \times 10^{-9}$, and $c_f=2/0.66=$1.2M:
\[  \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]^2 +1.33\times 10^{-9}\cdot \big[ \ce{OH^-} \big] -1.59\times 10^{-9}=0 \]
Solving for $\big[ \ce{OH^-} \big]$ we have $\big[ \ce{H^+} \big]=3.98\times 10^{-5}$M and therefore POH=4.4 and PH=9.59.
