Calculate the PH of 20mL of a 0.1M \ce{NH4Cl}/0.2M \ce{NH3} ($K_b=1.80 \times 10^{-5}$) after adding 1mL of HCl 0.3M. \\

In this example, we are adding an acid to a basic buffer. We have that $PK_a=9.25$, $V_a=V_b=20mL$, $c_a=0.1M$ and $c_b=0.2M$. As we are adding an acid we have $(V_b\cdot c_b)^{added}=0 $ and $(V_a\cdot c_a)^{added} =1\cdot 0.3=0.3$mM. Using Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation17}:
\[PH=9.25 + \text{log} \Big(\frac{20\cdot 0.2 - (1\cdot 0.3)^{added} }{20\cdot 0.1 + (1\cdot 0.3)^{added} }\Big)=9.46 \]
 We have that the original PH of the buffer is 9.56. After adding an acid, the new PH (9.46) remains close to the original buffer PH.
