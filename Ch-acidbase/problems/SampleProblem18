The following example demonstrate how to select the appropriate PH formula for a titration. They key is to identify the location in terms of the endpoint (before, at or after) and the nature of the titrate (strong, weak, acid or base).

\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
A 25mL sample of 3M HCl is titrated by 25 mL of a \ce{NaOH} 2M solution. \begin{inparaenum}[(a)] 
\item identify the titrate and titrant, and indicate whether you are before, after or at the endpoint
\item indicate whether the titrate is an acid or a base, and a weak or a strong electrolyte
\item indicate the formula that would need to be used from Table \ref{tab:Table-Titration-formulas} to calculate the PH 
\item calculate the PH 
\end{inparaenum}

As they say HCl is titrated with NaOH, therefore hydrochloric acid is the titrate (the one that is being titrated) and sodium hydroxide is the titrant--the one used to titrate. The titrant is a strong acid. In order to find out whether we are before, at or after the endpoint, we will have to use Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation13} and calculate the volume of titrant needed to neutralize the titrate. If the volume of titrant we have used is less than the endoint volume then we will be before the end point. If the titrant volume is larger then we will be beyond the end point. We will be at the endpoint if the volume of titrant used is the same as the endpoint volume. We have that $c_a=$3M, $V_a=25$mL, and $n_{H}=$1. We also have that $c_b=$2M, and $n_{OH}=$1. We will calculate $V_b$ that fulfills Equation \ref{\chapterlabel:equation13}:
\[  1\cdot 3\cdot 25=1\cdot 2\cdot V_b \]
Therefore, $V_b=$37.5mL. As we have used only 25mL of base, we would be before the endpoint and the formula to use for the endpoint PH would be: $\big[ \ce{H^+} \big]= c_{R}$. We can calculate $c_{R}$:
\[\begin{split}c_R=\frac{\rvert n_{H}\cdot c_a\cdot V_a -n_{OH}\cdot c_b\cdot V_b \lvert}{V_a+V_b}=\frac{\rvert 1\cdot 3M\cdot 25mL -1\cdot 2M\cdot 25mL \lvert}{(25+25)mL}=\\=0.5M\end{split} \]
We have that PH=-log$c_R$=0.30.
