A 5mL sample of 2M \ce{H2SO4} is titrated by 25 mL of a \ce{NaOH} 1M solution.
 \begin{inparaenum}[(a)] 
\item indicate whether you are before, after or at the endpoint
\item indicate whether the titrate is an acid or a base, and a weak or a strong electrolyte
\item indicate the formula that would need to be used to calculate the PH
\item calculate the PH
