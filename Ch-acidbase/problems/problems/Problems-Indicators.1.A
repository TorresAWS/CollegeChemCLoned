We 10mL of titrate a 0.1M-\ce{CH3COOH} ($K_a=1.8\times 10^{-5}$) solution with 0.01M-NaOH using methyl red ($K_{In}=9\times 10^{-6}$) that is yellow on its acid form and orange on its basic form. Answer the following questions:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  What is the initial color of the solution  	%yellow
\item  After adding 50mL of NaOH, indicate the color of the solution  	%yellow
\item  After adding 150mL of NaOH, indicate the color of the solution  	%orange
\item  What is the PH of the equivalency point  	%PH=5.56
\item  At what PH will the color transition occur  	%PH=4 using the 10\% rule.
 \end{inparaenum}
