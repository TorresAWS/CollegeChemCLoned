Compare the acidity of the following pairs and justify the mechanism responsible for your choice:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item \ce{H2S} and \ce{HCl}% (\ce{HCl} due to electronegativity of central atom)
\item \ce{SiH4} and \ce{GeH4}% (\ce{GeH4} due to MW of central atom)
\item \ce{CH3CH2OH} and \ce{CH3COOH}% (\ce{CH3COOH} due to larger number of oxygens)
\item \ce{CH3CH2OH} and \ce{CH3CHFOH}% (\ce{CH3CHFOH} due to EN)
 \end{enumerate}
