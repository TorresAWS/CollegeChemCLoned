Solve the following titration scenarios:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item In a titration experiment, 13.5 mL of 0.34 M \ce{HCl} neutralize 34.3 mL of KOH. What is the concentration of the \ce{KOH} solution? %0.13M
\item In a titration experiment, 20.4 mL of 0.10 M \ce{HCl} neutralize 12.4 mL of \ce{Ca(OH)2}. What is the concentration of the base solution? %0.08M
 \end{inparaenum}
