Oxalid acid \ce{HO2C-CO2H} is the simplest dicarboxylic acid ($PK_{a1}=1.2$  and $PK_{a2}=4.2$). It is a white crystalline solid that forms a colorless solution in water. We titrate 50mL of 0.1M \ce{HO2C-CO2H} solution with 0.1M \ce{NaOH}. Answer the questions below:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  Calculate the PH after adding 25mL of base %1.2
\item  Calculate the PH after adding 50mL of base %2.7
\item  Calculate the PH after adding 75mL of base %4.2
\item  Calculate the PH after adding 100mL of base %6.12
\item  Calculate the PH after adding 150mL of base %12.39
