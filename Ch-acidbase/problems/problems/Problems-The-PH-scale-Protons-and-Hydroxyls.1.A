Answer the following questions:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item The proton concentration of a solution is $1\times 10^{-10}$M. Calculate the hydroxyl concentration in the same solution %$1\times 10^{-4}$M
\item The hydroxyl concentration of a solution is $3\times 10^{-5}$M. Calculate the proton concentration in the same solution.%$3.3\times 10^{-10}$M
 \end{inparaenum}
