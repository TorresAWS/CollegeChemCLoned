\item If you miss the final quiz your final grade will be commputed using a zero for the final quiz.
\item There are no make-ups for missed quizzes or HW.
\item If you submit any HW late you will substracted 5 points a day.
\item You need to bring a scientific calculator to class and your phone does not count as one.
\item For level 2 classes (CHEM 202) you need a graphing calculator (Casio is a good brand)
\item Class work can only be done during class, hence your attendance is critical for this grade component.
\item If you miss a class with a classwork component you miss the corresponding grade.
\item You may bring a cheat sheet on 8.5x11 paper to the exam written on both sides. No more than a single sheet will be allowed under any circumstance. If you are seen in a quiz with more than a single page, the instructor has the right to reduce your quiz grade by 20 points.
