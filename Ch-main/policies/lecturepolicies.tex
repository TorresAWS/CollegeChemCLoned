\begin{enumerate}
\item You need to bring a scientific calculator to class and your phone does not count as one.
\item For level 2 classes (CHEM 202) you need a graphing calculator (Casio is a good brand)
\item There are no make-ups for missed quizzes or HW.  
\item If you submit any HW late you will penalized with 5 points a day.
\item Class work can only be done during class, hence your attendance is critical for this component of the grade.
\item If you miss a class with a classwork component you miss the corresponding grade.
\item You may bring a cheat sheet on 8.5x11 paper to the exam.
\item Assignments in wich you had tech issues during submission will waived unless you reach out the day of the deadline
\end{enumerate}
