The term \textbf{"hard water"} refers to the concentration of certain minerals in the water. This topic concerns \textbf{aqueous solutions} in which water is the solvent and minerals are the solutes. These minerals are ionic compounds that dissociate in aqueous solutions producing ions. The hardness of water is an indication of the concentration of \ce{Ca^2+} and \ce{Mg^2+} ions. 

\subsection*{Dissolving the insoluble}

\ce{Ca^2+} and \ce{Mg^2+} ions originate in limestone (\ce{CaCO3}, the material of the pyramids) and chalk (\ce{MgCO3}, used to write on the chalkboard) deposits. However, chalk will not dissolve in water and neither the pyramids dissolve in the rain. How is dissolving these carbonates possible?

\subsection*{The answer is in the air}

Water in contact with the air absorbs \ce{CO2} in the atmosphere according to the equation:
\begin{align*} 			% Use align* to align the formulas at the arrows with align the & for equations is not working
\ce{CO2 (g) + H2O (l) &-> H2CO3 (aq)}		%  well, I removed it the symbol & indicates where to do the alignment
\end{align*}	
Where \ce{H2CO3} is carbonic acid, which reacts with the carbonate to form hydrogen bicarbonate. For the case of \ce{CaCO3}\\
\begin{align*} 
\ce{CaCO3 (s) + H2CO3 (aq) &-> Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)}
\end{align*}
Calcium hydrogen carbonate is also called calcium bicarbonate. Bicarbonates are soluble in water (baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, \ce{NaCO3}) and, as ionic compounds, they are dissociated into its ions;
\begin{align*}  
\ce{Ca(HCO3)2 (aq) &-> Ca^2+ + 2HCO3-}
\end{align*}
The overall reaction is the 3 previous equations added together:
\begin{align*} 
\ce{CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l) &->Ca^2+ + 2HCO3-}
\end{align*}
and this is how carbonates dissolve in water. 

Sodium hydrogen carbonate can decompose under different conditions. On one hand, in acidic conditions, it produces carbonic acid that quickly decomposes to give carbon dioxide:
\begin{align*} 
 \ce{NaHCO3_{(aq)}  ->[H^+] Na^+ + CO2_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)}}\\ \vspace{1cm}
\end{align*}
On the other side, when heated it produces: 
 \ce{2NaHCO3_{(aq)}  ->[$\Delta$] Na2CO3 + CO2_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)}}\\ \vspace{1cm}

\subsection*{Implications in daily life}

The presence of these ions in water has several implications for routine actions in our lives. The problem arises when the latter reaction takes place in the opposite direction, releasing \ce{CO2} gas in the process and depositing solid carbonate. This direction is favored when water is heated and explains the white residue in bathrooms and kettles. This is especially a problem for boilers, that suffer from scaling when operating hard water.

\subsection*{The experiment}

The experiment consists of four parts: preparing the ion exchange resin, measuring the hardness of a sample of water, reducing the hardness also called softening, of the sample, and testing the hardness of the softened sample. Additionally, a series of simple reactions will be done to test the reactivity of \ce{Ca^{2+}} and \ce{Mg^{2+}} ions.

\subsection*{Measuring the hardness of the sample}

The concentration of \ce{Ca^2+} ions, or any other metallic cation, is usually measured by titration of the aqueous sample using a sodium salt as the titrant, a solution of known concentration added to the sample. First, an indicator will be added to the sample which will color the solution pink. The indicator chosen is Eriochrome Black T, which will turn blue when the \ce{Ca^2+} ion is removed from the cation-indicator complex:
\begin{center} 
%indicator\:complex &\hspace{18 mm} indicator\:alone\\
\ce{      $\underset{indicator\;complex \;(pink) }{\ce{Ca(In)^{2+}_{(aq)}}}$    ->  Ca^{2+}_{(aq)}  +  $\underset{indicator \;(blue) }{\ce{In_{(aq)}}}$     }  
 \end{center}

To achieve the color change \ce{H2EDTA^2-} will be used. \ce{H2EDTA^2-}  (dihydrogen ethylenediaminetetraacetate) is an anion with a stronger affinity for the \ce{Ca^2+} cations than the indicator. As \ce{H2EDTA^2-} is added to the solution it will replace the indicator forming a new complex, leaving the indicator alone, which in turn will become blue.

\begin{center} 
%indicator\:complex &\hspace{18 mm} indicator\:alone\\
\ce{   H2EDTA^{2-}_{(aq)}   +  $\underset{(pink)}{\ce{ Ca(In)^{2+}_{(aq)}   }}$    <-> Ca(EDTA)^{2+}_{(aq)} + $\underset{(blue)}{\ce{ In_{(aq)}   }}$   +2H^+_{(aq)}         }  
 \end{center}

 

Even when the example described above refers to calcium ions, the same chemistry applies to magnesium ions.
It is important to note down the exact number of drops required to achieve the endpoint of the titration.

\subsection*{Softening the hard water}

After measuring the hardness of the water sample, the next step is to soften the water. \emph{Softening} is the process where ions, particularly calcium and magnesium ions, are removed from the water. When a hard water sample is softened we can refer to it as \emph{softened water}. A cation-exchange resin will be used to soften the water. This resin contains many sulfonic groups, (\ce{-SO3H}). Every two hydrogens in these acidic groups will be replaced by a metallic cation, \ce{Ca^{2+}} and \ce{Mg^{2+}}, in a mechanism called \emph{cation exchange}. Finally, it is necessary to evaluate whether the water sample has been softened. As such the titration performed in Part A will be repeated, but this time with the softened sample. The most relevant parameter is the amount of EDTA added to achieve the endpoint of the titration, to compare this result to the previous titration. This experiment aims to be a qualitative analysis of the water treatment. For that reason, and to simplify the process, the titration will be done using droppers instead of the more precise burette typically used in titrations.
