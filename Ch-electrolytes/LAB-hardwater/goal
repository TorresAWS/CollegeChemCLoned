The goal of this experiment is to understand the concepts of hard and soft water and their implications in daily life. The student will also experiment with the \emph{dissociation of ionic compounds} in water, from which the \textbf{hydrogen-donor} nature of the acids and the notion of \emph{pH} are emphasized. Other principles, such as equilibrium and ion exchange, are also presented.
