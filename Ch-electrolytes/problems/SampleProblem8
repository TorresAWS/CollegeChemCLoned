\begin{example} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE BOX
Predict the soluble/insoluble nature of the following compounds: (a) \ce{K2CO3}, (b) \ce{NaNO3} and (c) \ce{Ca(OH)2}.
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) \ce{K2CO3_{(aq)}} is soluble, as \ce{CO3^{-2}} is insoluble but when combined with \ce{K+} the salt becomes soluble. (b) All nitrates are soluble without exceptions. (c) \ce{Ca(OH)2_{(aq)}} is soluble.
