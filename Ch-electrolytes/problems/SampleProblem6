How much volume of a 4M solution do you need to provide 5 moles of solute.
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We will use the conversion factor of Molarity using the volume on top and the moles on the bottom in order to cancel the units:
\begin{equation*}
5   \cancel{\text{moles of solute}} \times 
\dfrac{\text{1 L of solution}  } {  4\cancel{\text{moles of solute }}} =1.25\text{L}
\end{equation*}
This means that 1.25L of a 4M solution will provide 5 moles of solute.
