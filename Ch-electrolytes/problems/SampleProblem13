Calculate the redox number of the elements underlined in the following molecules: (a) \ce{K2{\underline{C}}O3} and (b) \ce{H2{\underline{C}}O}.

\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
Let us set up the redox equation for the first compound, knowing that the redox of oxygen is $-2$ and potassium $+1$. The unknown variable $x$ represents the redox number of the underlined element. We have:
\[2\cdot (+1)+x+3\cdot (-2)=0\]
Mind we have two potassium and three oxygens hence we need to time the redox of \ce{K} by two and the redox of \ce{O} by three. If we solve for $x$ we obtain a redox number for carbon of $\text{IV}$. The redox equation for the second example is:
\[2\cdot (+1) + x+ (-2)=0\]
Mind that according to the redox rules, the redox number of oxygen is $+1$. Solving for $x$ we have a redox number of zero.
