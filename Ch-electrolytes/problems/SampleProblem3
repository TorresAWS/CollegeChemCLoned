Use polarity arguments to indicate if the following substances will mix: (a) \ce{H2O_{(g)}} and \ce{CH4_{(g)}}; (b) \ce{H2O_{(g)}} and \ce{HCl_{(g)}}
\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) Water and methane (\ce{CH4}) will not mix, as water is a polar molecule and \ce{CH4} (methane) is nonpolar. (b) They will mix as HCl is a polar molecule and so is water.
