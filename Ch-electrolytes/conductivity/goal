The terms of \textbf{conductivity} and \textbf{electrolytes} will be introduced and related to the concept of dissociation. The use of the conductivity meter, very similar to the pH meter, will help to differentiate between strong and weak electrolytes. In the last part of the experiment, the presence of chemical reactions will be identified by measuring changes in conductivity.
