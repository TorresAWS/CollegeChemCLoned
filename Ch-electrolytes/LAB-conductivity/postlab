\item Based on your results on Part B, which conductivity was higher, the one for distilled water or for tap water? Why? \vspace{3cm}



\item Based on your results on Part C, specifically the conductivity values of \ce{KCl} and \ce{KOH}, how does ion mobility affect conductivity (see table in the Background section)? Use your data to illustrate your answer.\vspace{3cm}


\item Based on your results on Part D, how does concentration affect conductivity? Use your data to illustrate your answer.\vspace{3cm}

%\item As you saw in this experiment, the degree of dissociation can be detected by measuring conductivity. In general terms Non-electrolytes present low conductivities, lower than 10S$\cdot $cm$^{-1}$, weak electrolytes present medium conductivities,  between 10-1000S$\cdot $cm$^{-1}$, and strong electrolytes present large conductivities, larger than 1000S$\cdot $cm$^{-1}$. Based on the conductivity measurements from the experiment, indicate whether each of the following is a weak electrolyte, a strong electrolyte, or a nonelectrolyte.

%\item Acids and bases are classified as strong or weak according to their degree of dissociation when dissolved in water. A weak acid/base will dissociate only partially, and a strong acid or base will dissociate completely. Relate this statement to your results and indicate whether each of the following is a weak acid, a strong acid, a weak base, or a strong base.
