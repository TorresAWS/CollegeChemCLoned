\begin{example}{Example}
\begin{it}The conductivity of a 0.050 M solutions of \ce{HNO3} is measure to be 19.6 mS/cm.\\
That of a 0.050 M solution of KCl is 9.6 mS/cm.\\
A new solution is prepared mixing 10 mL of \ce{HNO3} 0.10 M and 10 mL of \ce{KCl} 0.10 M. The conductivity of the resulting mixture is measure to be 29.6 mS/cm.\\
Calculate the concentration of each spices in the mixture and determine if their compounds have reacted or not.

\end{it}
\Sepline
\begin{bf}Answer\end{bf}: To calculate the new concentration use the formula for dilutions:
\begin{center}$V_1\times M_1=V_2\times M_2$
\end{center}
where $V_1$ and $M_1$ are the initial volume and concentration and $V_2$ and $M_2$ are the values after the dilution.\\
We look for $M_2$, therefore
\begin{center}$M_2=V_1\times \dfrac{M_1}{V_2}$
\end{center}
for \ce{HNO3},
\begin{center}$M_2=\dfrac{10\:mL\times 0.10\:M}{(10\:mL+10\:mL)}=0.05\:M$
\end{center}
The same values apply for \ce{KCl}.\\
We can see that the addition of the separate conductivities is very close to the total conductivity of the mixture with the same concentrations for each electrolyte.\\
\begin{center}Cond. (\ce{HNO3} 0.05 M) + Cond (\ce{KCl} 0.05 M) = 19.6 mS/cm + 9.6 mS/cm = 29.2 mS/cm\\
Cond. \ce{HNO3} 0.05M + \ce{KCl} 0.05M = 29.6 mS/cm
\end{center}
The additivity rules applies, meaning that there is no reaction between \ce{HNO3} and \ce{KCl}.
