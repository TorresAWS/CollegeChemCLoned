\subsection*{Preparing the setup.}
\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Prepare the set-up to cool down the solution. Set up a ring stand and an iron ring with wire gauze on top. The height of the platform will normally be very low. 
	\newstep[] Use a second, larger ring above the platform as protection. Attach a small clamp above the second iron ring.
	\newstep[] Put ice in a 250 mL beaker and set it on the platform.

\subsection*{Preparing a cyclohexane sample.}
\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Find  100mL and 50mL beakers and a 20 mL pipet.  
	\newstep[] Obtain a large test tube that is clean and dry, a suitable rubber stopper, and a 100 mL beaker. The beaker will be used to hold the test tube vertically. Get the mass of the test tube with stopper and the beaker in the scale and write it down in the Results section.
	\newstep[] Pour no more than 25 mL of cyclohexane into the 50 mL beaker. Using the pipet, transfer exactly 20.0 mL of cyclohexane from the 50 mL beaker to the test tube and close it with the stopper immediately. Mind that as the liquid is volatile the measured volume will not be accurate. Using the scale get the mass of the test tube with the cyclohexane, the stopper, and the beaker.
	\newstep[] Get the mass of the filled-test tube with stopper and the beaker in the scale and write it down in the Results section.
\end{steps}


\subsection*{Part A. Freezing point of the pure solvent.}
\begin{steps}
	\newstep[] Insert the test tube into the ice and hold it vertically using the clamp. Find the perforated stoppers with the stirring wire and the thermometer. The round wire end must encircle the thermometer probe. Exchange the stopper on the test tube with this gadget.
	\newstep[] As soon as the temperature is 15$^{\circ}$C (or lower) start stirring the solvent with the wire and record the temperature every 15 seconds. Use all the digits given by the thermometer, i.e. down to the tenth of the degree Celsius.
\newstep[] Start plotting the results on the graph. Plotting temperature (in $\circ$C) in the vertical axis and time in the horizontal axis.



	\newstep[] Stop the experiment when the temperature starts dropping after several minutes of having a constant temperature. Do not stop until the temperature reaches 3$^{\circ}$C.
	\newstep[] Now you will repeat the measurement one more time.
	\newstep[] Lift the test tube with the clamp above the ice and allow the cyclohexane to melt. Avoid using your hands to accelerate the process. Before the cyclohexane gets to 15$^{\circ}$C get a second measurement by repeating the step above. 
\end{steps}

\subsection*{Part B. Freezing point of the less concentrated solution.}\begin{steps}
\newstep[] Pick up an unknown solute.
	\newstep[] The same cyclohexane can be used in Part B. However, if you work in teams you can prepare another cyclohexane sample and carry out work in parallel.

	\newstep[] If you use the sample from part A, lift the test tube with the clamp above the ice and allow the cyclohexane to melt. Avoid using your hands to accelerate the process. During the next steps be careful to avoid the cyclohexane's temperature from getting above 15$^{\circ}$C.

	\newstep[] If you prepare a new cyclohexane sample, see the steps above.

	\newstep[] Tare the scale with the weighing boat and obtain between 0.10 g and 0.11 g of the unknown solute. Remove the boat with the solute, tare the empty scale, and record the mass of the weighing boat together with the solute. Use the balance of maximum precision.
	\newstep[] Carefully add the solute into the test tube with the pure solvent. Make sure no solute is spilled. There is no need to add all the solute from the weighing boat, the amount added will be calculated by difference.
	\newstep[] Weight the weighing boat with the solute leftovers. Record the mass on the results page.
	\newstep[] Mix the solution well and insert the test tube in the ice while holding it vertically using the clamp. 
	\newstep[] Start stirring the solution with the wire and record the temperature every 15 seconds. This time the temperature should not reach constant. Stop the experiment when the temperature reaches 1$^{\circ}$C.
\end{steps}

\subsection*{Part C. Freezing point of the more concentrated solution.}\begin{steps}

	\newstep[] Lift the test tube with the clamp above the ice and allow the cyclohexane to melt. Avoid using your hands to accelerate the process. During the next steps be careful to avoid the cyclohexane getting above 15$^{\circ}$C.
	\newstep[] The same boat can be reused without cleaning. Tare the scale with the boat inside. Obtain between 0.24 g and 0.25 g of the unknown solute and record the mass of the weighing boat together with the solute using maximum precision.
	\newstep[] Add carefully the solute into the test tube with the pure solvent. Make sure no solute is spilled. There is no need to add all the solute from the weighing boat, the amount added will be calculated by difference.
	\newstep[] Weight the weighing boat with the solute leftovers. Record the mass on the results page.
	\newstep[] Mix the solution well and insert the test tube in the ice while holding it vertically using the clamp. 
	\newstep[] Start stirring the solution with the wire and record the temperature every 15 seconds. This time the temperature should not reach a constant. Stop the experiment when the temperature reaches 0.5$^{\circ}$C.
