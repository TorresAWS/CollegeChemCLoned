Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of a solute and a solvent (see Figure \red{Fig:Figure-Dissolution}). Homogeneous means that if you look at the mixture you will not be able to differentiate both components and you will only see it as a whole. In a solution, the solute is the component of the mixture in less amount, whereas the solvent is the component in a larger amount. Think about mixing sugar with water. Sugar is sweet and water tasteless. When you mix both, you form a solution of sugar (solute) in water (solvent) and you will not see sugar in the solution as it is dissolved. In this particular example, sugar will be the solute in the solution, as the sugar is in less amount than water. Is important to remember that a solution is a result or mixing a solute and a solvent:
