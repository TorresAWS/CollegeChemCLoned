Each of the different concentration units--molarity, mass percent, volume percent, mass/volume percent--can be used in a conversion factor form. For example, if the molarity of a solution is 3M, this means that in the solution there is 3 moles of solute every one litter of solution. 
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{   \text{3M}\quad\text{ or }\quad \frac{3\text{ mol of solute}}{1\text{ L of solution}}\quad\text{ or }\quad   \frac{1\text{ L of solution}}{3\text{ mol of solute}}}   
\end{equation*}
Similarly, if the mass percent of a solution is 5\% this means that there is 5 grams of solute every 100 grams of solution. We often use concentration units as conversion factors when we need to transform between on unit on top (bottom) of the conversion factor and the unit on the bottom (top).
