How do we calculate the redox number for example of manganese in this chemical: \ce{{\underline{Mn}}O4^-}, permanganate? To do this, we need to set up a formula so that the redox numbers of all elements in the molecule--taking into account the number of atoms in the molecule--are equal to the charge. In the case of permanganate, let us call $x$ to the redox number of manganese. We know the redox of oxygen is $-2$ and we have four oxygens in the molecule. We also know the charge of the ion is $-1$. Therefore we have:
\[x+4\cdot (-2)=-1\]
If we solve for $x$ we obtain the redox number of manganese of $\text{VII}$.
