There are three different reactions in solution: acid-base reactions, precipitation reactions, and redox reactions. The key to identifying acid-base reactions is in the reactants, as an acid-base reaction results from the reaction between an acid and a base. Precipitation reactions are reactions that produce a precipitate. Hence, the key to identifying a precipitation reaction is in the products. Precipitation reactions always contain a solid as a product. Redox reactions contain two elements with different redox numbers in the reactants and products. The key to identifying redox reactions is to be able to spot elements with different oxidation states, for example: \ce{Cu} and \ce{Cu^{2+}} or \ce{H^+} and \ce{H2}. In the following, we will describe more about the three different types of reactions in solution. The goal of this section is for you to be able to identify each type.
