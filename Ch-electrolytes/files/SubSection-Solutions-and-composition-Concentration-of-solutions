     \item[\docfilehook{Concentration of solutions}{}]                       
One of the most important properties of a solution is its concentration. The larger the concentration of a solution the more solute in the solution. There are many different concentration units, such as molarity or mass percent concentration. This section will introduce you to some of the most important concentration units.
\item[\docfilehook{Meaning of concentration}{Meaning of concentration}] The concentration of a solution refers to the amount of solute with respect to the amount of solution. The larger concentration the larger number of solute particles with respect to the solution. 
\item[\docfilehook{Mass percent concentration}{Mass percent concentration}] The mass percent (m/m) is the amount of solute in grams per grams of solution in percent form
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ m/m=\frac{\text{g of solute}}{\text{g of solution}}\times 100}   
\end{equation*}
