On one hand, electrolytes are compounds that conduct electricity once dissolved in water. Differently, nonelectrolytes are compounds that do not conduct electricity once dissolved in water. On the other hand, insoluble compounds are not soluble in water, whereas soluble compounds can be dissolved in water. This section covers the properties of electrolytes and insoluble (and soluble) compounds. At the end of this section, you should be able to classify a chemical in terms of its electrolyte type and solubility character.
