\item[\docfilehook{Mixing and polarity}{}] A solution is formed when both the solute and the solvent mix. However, they will only mix if they have the same polarity. As an example, water (\ce{H2O}) is a polar molecule and methanol (\ce{CH3-OH}) too. Hence they will both mix and form a solution. If the elements of a mixture have different polarity they will not mix. An example is benzene (\ce{C6H6}, nonpolar) and water, or for example oil (nonpolar) and water (polar).
