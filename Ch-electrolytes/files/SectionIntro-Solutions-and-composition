Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two components. The state of the matter of both components of the mixture or their polarity affects the formation of a solution. For example, a solution will not result from mixing oil and water as they have different polar characteristics and it will form from mixing table salt and water as both are polar chemicals. At the same time, the more solute you add to a solution the more concentrated the solution will be. This section covers polarity and the composition of solutions.
