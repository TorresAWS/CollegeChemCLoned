\item[\docfilehook{Solubility formula}{}] Solubility ($s$) is the grams of a solute per 100 g of solvent:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ s=\frac{\text{g of solute}}{\text{100 g of solvent}} }   
\end{equation*}
A saturated solution can be achieved when you fit the maximum amount of solute in the solvent. If you continue adding solute to a saturated solution it will precipitate and solid will form.
