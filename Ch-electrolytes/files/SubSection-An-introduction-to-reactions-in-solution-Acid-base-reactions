\item[\docfilehook{Acid-base reactions}{}] Acid-base reactions result from the reaction of an acid with a base. Both they produce water and another chemical. An example is:
\begin{center}\ce{HBr_{(aq)} +  KOH_{(aq)}  ->  KBr_{(aq)}  +  H2O_{(l)} \textcolor{red}{ (acid-base reaction) }}\end{center}
Hydrobromic acid (\ce{HBr}) is an acid and potassium hydroxide (\ce{KOH}) a base.
The result of an acid-base reaction is always water and an ionic compound, in this case \ce{KBr}.
