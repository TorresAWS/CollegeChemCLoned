You can use the Table below to identify the electrolyte character of a chemical. Ionic compounds are in general strong electrolytes, and most acids are as well. There are four important weak electrolytes: water, acetic acid, ammonia, and hydrofluoric acid. Covalent compounds are in general nonelectrolytes. Organic compounds, compounds based on carbon atoms (e.g. \ce{C12H22O11}) are in general nonelectrolytes.
