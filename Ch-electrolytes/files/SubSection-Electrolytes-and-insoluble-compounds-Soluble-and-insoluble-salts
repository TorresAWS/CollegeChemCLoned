Soluble compounds dissolve in water, whereas insoluble compounds do not. For example, barium chromate (\ce{BaCrO4_{(s)}}) is an insoluble salt. How do we know that? The Table below will help you predict the solubility of a salt. To do this, you need to start by assessing the right ion (the anion, \ce{CrO4^{2-}}) located in the left column of the Table below. After that, you need to assess the left ion (the cation, \ce{Ba^{2+}}) located in the right column. If you follow this, you will see that chromate is insoluble and barium is not part of any exception. Let us predict for example the soluble/insoluble nature of \ce{CaSO4}, calcium sulfate. We start by looking for \ce{SO4^{2-}} in the left column to find out is soluble. Next, we continue in the same line as \ce{SO4^{2-}} and look for the ion in the left \ce{Ca^{2+}}. In conclusion, even when \ce{SO4^{2-}}  is soluble, when combined with \ce{Ca^{2+}}, we have that \ce{CaSO4} is insoluble, and overall \ce{CaSO4_{(s)}} is insoluble.
