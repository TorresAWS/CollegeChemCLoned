By comparing the redox number of the same element in two different compounds we can figure out in what compound the element has lost or gained electrons. Look for example the case of \ce{{\underline{Cr\textsuperscript{VI}}}2O7^{2-}} and  \ce{{\underline{Cr\textsuperscript{III}}}2O3}. The same element in two different molecules has two different redox numbers. In the case of dichromate, the redox of \ce{Cr} is  $\text{VI}$, whereas in the case of chromium(III) oxide the redox of \ce{Cr} is $\text{III}$. The larger the redox number the more oxidized is an element, and that means the element has lost electrons. The smaller the redox number the more reduced is the element and that means it has gained electrons. If we compare both case, we have that \ce{Cr} in dichromate is oxidized--it lost electrons--and \ce{Cr} in chromium(III) oxide is reduced--it gained electrons.
