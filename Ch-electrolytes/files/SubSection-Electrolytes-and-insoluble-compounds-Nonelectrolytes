\item[\docfilehook{Nonelectrolytes}{}] Nonelectrolytes do not dissociate in water. Hence a solution of a nonelectrolyte will only contains molecules and not ions. Examples of nonelectrolytes are carbon-based chemicals such as methanol, ethanol, urea or sucrose. The dissociation of urea for example \ce{CH4N2O} proceeds as:
\begin{center}\ce{CH4N2O_{(s)}  ->[H2O] CH4N2O_{(aq)} }\end{center}
\item[\docfilehook{Identify the electrolyte character of a chemical}{Identify the electrolyte character of a chemical}] You can use the Table below to identify the electrolyte character of a chemical. Ionic compounds are in general strong electrolytes, and most acids as well. There is four important weak electrolytes: water, acetic acid, ammonia and hydrofluoric acid. Covalent compounds are in general nonelectrolytes. Organic compounds, compounds based on carbon atoms (e.g. \ce{C12H22O11}) are in general nonelectrolytes.
