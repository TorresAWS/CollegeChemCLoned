\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{he} most common reactions happen in solution. Think, for example, when you add sugar to your coffee or how a metal rusts when it gets wet. The first example involves a dissociation reaction, whereas the second a redox reaction. This chapter first covers the properties of solutions and the quantification of the amount of solute in a solution. This chapter also covers some important types of reactions happening in solution. Another important concept covered in this chapter is the idea of electrolytes. On one hand, most of you will be surprised to know that water do not conduct the electricity. This is because pure water is a weak electrolyte. On the other hand, the importance of electrolytes is well know among the sports community. If you have ever played a sport, you have probably chugged a sport drink. These are actually electrolyte solutions. However, few know the specifics of their function. Electrolytes are actually salts that conduct electricity in water by separating into positive and negative ions. In this chapter, you will be able to identify different types of electrolytes. Finally, here we will also cover some important reactions happening in solution. In particular reactions between acids and base, reaction that result in a solid and reaction involving an electron exchange.
