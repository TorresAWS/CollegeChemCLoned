\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{he} most common reactions happen in solution and involve cations and anions. Think, for example, when you add sugar to your coffee or how metal rusts when it gets wet. The first example involves a dissolution reaction, whereas the second a redox reaction in which electrons are being exchanged. Overall there are three main different types of reactions happening in solutions. It is not only important to be able to differentiate these reactions, but it is also important to understand the nuances between acid-base reactions, precipitation reactions, and redox reactions. It is also critical to understand the properties of solutions and learn how to quantify and compare the amount of solute in a solution. On one hand, most of you will be surprised to know that water does not conduct electricity. This is because pure water is a weak electrolyte. On the other hand, the importance of electrolytes is well known among the sports community. If you have ever played a sport, you have probably chugged a sports drink. These are electrolyte solutions. However, few know the specifics of their function. Electrolytes are salts that conduct electricity in water by separating into positive and negative ions. To understand the properties of solutions it is important to identify and differentiate the different types of electrolytes.
