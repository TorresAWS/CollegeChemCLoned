You can prepare different types of solutions by mixing a solid and a liquid, like when you mix sugar and water, or salt and water. You can create solutions as well by mixing two liquids or two solids. Examples are vinegar--a liquid solution of acetic acid (liquid) in water (liquid)--or steel-- a solid solution that contains iron and carbon, both solids.
