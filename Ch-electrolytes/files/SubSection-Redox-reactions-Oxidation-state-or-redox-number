\item[\docfilehook{Oxidation state or redox number}{}] The redox number, also called oxidation number or oxidation state helps compare elements that have lost (or gained) different charge. When comparing two elements with different redox numbers, the larger this number the more electrons the element has lost. Similarly, the smaller this number the smaller this number the more electrons the element has won.
