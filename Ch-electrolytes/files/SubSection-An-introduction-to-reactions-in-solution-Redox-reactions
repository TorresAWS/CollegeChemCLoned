 Redox reactions are different than acid-base or precipitation reactions. They contain the same chemical element in two different states resulting from the loss or win of electrons. Look for the example:
\begin{center}\ce{2Al_{(s)} + 3Cu^{+2}_{(aq)} -> 2Al^{+3}_{(aq)} + 3Cu_{(s)}       }\textcolor{red}{ (redox reaction) }\end{center}
We have that neither \ce{Al_{(s)}} or \ce{Cu_{(aq)}^{+2}} are an acid or a base, therefore this is not an acid-base reaction. Also, there is no insoluble product, hence this is not a precipitation reaction. Indeed, this is a redox reaction, as we have \ce{Al} in two different states: as metallic \ce{Al_{(s)}} and as ionic  \ce{Al_{(aq)}^{+3}}, which result from the loss of three electrons. Therefore in a redox reaction, there are always elements in the chemicals that lose electrons. In redox reactions, there is also an element that wins electrons. For example, \ce{Cu_{(s)}} and \ce{Cu_{(aq)}^{+2}} have different redox number. In particular, \ce{Cu_{(aq)}^{+2}} is the result of removing three electrons from \ce{Cu_{(s)}}. At this point, we have that this reaction is redox as it contains an element that gains electrons and an element that loses electrons. Sometimes, the redox state of the elements is not that obvious. Look at this example:
\begin{center}\ce{Fe_{(s)} +   CuSO4_{(aq)} -> FeSO4_{(aq)} +   Cu_{(s)}      }\textcolor{red}{ (redox reaction) }\end{center}
This is a redox reaction as you can find iron and copper in two states, metallic and also ionic. Therefore, these two metals have two different redox numbers in the reaction.
