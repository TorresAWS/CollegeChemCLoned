Imagine we suggest a possible mechanism for a reaction with an experimental rate law and we want to make sure this is an appropriate mechanism. An appropriate chemical mechanism follows two rules: (a) the combination of all steps gives the overall reaction and (b) the experimental rate law can be justified by means of the mechanistic steps.
