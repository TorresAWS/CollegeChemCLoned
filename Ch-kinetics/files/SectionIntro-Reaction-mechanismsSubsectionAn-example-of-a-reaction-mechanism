Let us analyze the reaction between nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, with the experimental rate law indicate below:
\ce{NO2_{(g)} + CO_{(g)} -> NO_{(g)} + CO2_{(g)}}{ \hfill $r^{Exp}=k^{Exp}[\ce{NO2}]^2$} \\
The experimental rate law demonstrates that this is a second order reaction. The reaction mechanism associated with the overall reaction is shown below. It consists of two steps. The first step involve the reaction of two nitrogen dioxide molecules (\ce{NO2})--one of the reactants--to produce a molecule of nitrogen trioxide and a nitrogen monoxide molecule (\ce{NO3})--one of the products. The second step involves the reaction of nitrogen trioxide (\ce{NO3}) and carbon monoxide (\ce{CO})--a second reactant--to produce nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide--the second product.

All reactions in a mechanism are called elemental steps and hence they proceed in a single step. At the same time, for each step, the number of molecules involved in the reactants is called molecularity and directly corresponds to the order or the rate law for a given step. Reactions involving a single molecule are called unimolecular, whereas reactions involving two molecules are called bimolecular. Reactions involving three molecules are called termolecular and are very rare. We have that every single step of the mechanism has a reaction constant ($k_1$ and $k_2$) and a rate law ($r_1$ and $r_2$). The rate law of each step of the mechanism simply results from multiplying the rate constant by the molarity of all reactants, using the stoichiometric coefficients are powers. For example the first step involves two \ce{NO2} molecules and hence the rate law involve $[\ce{NO2}]^2$. At the same time, every step is characterized by a certain speed. Some steps are slower (step 1) than other (step 2). By combining the different steps and eliminating the repeated species we can obtain the overall reaction:
\begin{center}(1)\hfill\ce{NO2_{(g)} + NO2_{(g)} ->[$k_1$]   $\textcolor{red}{\ce{NO3_{(g)}}}$  + NO_{(g)}}{ \hfill(\small slow)\hfill $r_1=k_1[\ce{NO2}]^2$} \\
(2)\hfill\ce{$\textcolor{red}{\ce{NO3_{(g)}}}$  + CO_{(g)} ->[$k_2$] NO2_{(g)} + CO2_{(g)}}{  \hfill(\small fast)\hfill $r_2=k_2[\ce{NO3}][\ce{CO}]$}

\end{center}
Finally, there are three different types of molecules in a mechanism: overall reactants, overall products and intermediates. Overall reactants are the reactants of the overall reaction (indicated in green). Overall products are the products of the overall reaction (indicated in orange). Intermediates (indicated in red) are generated only inside the mechanism and are not involved in the overall reaction. They are very ephemeral states that exist only temporally and they are never part of any experimental rate law.
