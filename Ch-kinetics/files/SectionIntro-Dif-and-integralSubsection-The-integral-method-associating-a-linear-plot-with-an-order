The base of the integral method is to create three different plots: (a) $[\ce{A}]$ vs. $t$ (b) $\text{Ln}[\ce{A}]$ vs. $t$ and (c) $\frac{1}{[\ce{A}]}$ vs. $t$. In all plots, time is always indicated in the horizontal axis. Based on the data, only one of the plots will be the best linear plot with a  regression coefficient $r^2$ closer to one. The perfect linear plot will be associated with an order (here, either 0, 1, or 2). If the plot $[\ce{A}]$ vs. $t$ gives a perfect line the reaction will be zeroth-order. If the plot $Ln([\ce{A}])$ vs. $t$ gives a perfect line the reaction will be first order. If the plot $\frac{1}{[\ce{A}]}$ vs. $t$ gives a perfect line the reaction will be second-order. It is convenient to practice identifying the different plots and associating them with an order. The following example covers just that.
