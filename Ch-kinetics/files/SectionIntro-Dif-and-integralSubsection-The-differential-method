The differential method also called the method of the initial rates measures velocities for different concentrations, and in particular, measures initial velocities. These are velocities at very short times after the reaction starts. This method is convenient when there are parasite reactions that compete with the reaction one wants to study. By using initial rates, we can minimize the impact of competing reactions on the kinetic data.
In this method, by comparing different velocities for different concentrations one can calculate the reaction order and the rate constant, that is, one can construct the rate law. The next example will show you how to use this method. As a note, one can only use the differential method when reaction rates data is supplied.
