The reaction law is more specifically called a differential reaction law as it represents a differential equation--this is a mathematical term to describe equations in terms of derivatives. For a differential rate law, there is an integral rate law. The integral rate law is obtained using a mathematical technique called integration--this technique is out of the scope of this class. For example, below we have an example of a differential and integral rate law for a first-order reaction.
\begin{center}$r =0.01[\ce{N2O5}]$ \hspace{1cm}and\hspace{1cm} $\text{Ln}[\ce{N2O5}]=-0.01\cdot t+\text{Ln}(0.1)$\end{center}
In the differential rate law, we have the explicit reaction rate $r$ accompanied by molarities ([\ce{N2O5}]), whereas in the corresponding integral rate law we have molarities ([\ce{N2O5}]) accompanied of time. The integral rate law gives the change of the concentration with time, whereas the differential rate law gives the change of the reaction rate with concentration. Each type of law has its purpose and differential rate laws are more common and used when we have experimental data in terms of reaction rates and molarities. The integrated rate law is used when we have data in terms of molarity and time. Overall, differential rate laws and integral rate laws are exchangeable. To convert a differential rate law into its corresponding integral rate law we just need the initial concentration of the species involved in the law, $[\ce{A}]_0$. For example, the corresponding differential and integral rate law for a zeroth-order reaction are:
Table \ref{tab:Table-integral-formulas} reports the corresponding differential and integral rate laws for different orders.
