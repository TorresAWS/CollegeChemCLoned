Most chemical reactions do not occur in a single step but in a series of steps that connect reactants with products in the form of a  reaction mechanism. Some of the steps of the mechanism are slow--heavily impacting the experimentally measured rate law--others proceed quickly or are equilibrated hence going backwards. A proper reaction mechanism will justify the experimental rate law while matching the overall reaction stoichiometry. This section will gain insight into the different nuances involving reaction mechanisms, first giving an example of a reaction mechanism, then describing to of the most important steps of mechanisms: the rate-limiting step and the equilibrated steps. The first step gives the experimental rate law whereas the second is useful to calculate the concentration of reaction intermediates.
