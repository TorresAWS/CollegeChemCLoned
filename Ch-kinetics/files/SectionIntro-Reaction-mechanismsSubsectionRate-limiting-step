The rate limiting step of a mechanism approximately corresponds to the slowest step as this step will determine the experimental rate law:

The sign $\sim$ indicated that this is an approximation. Rate limiting steps represent bottlenecks of chemical mechanisms limiting the overall advance of the reaction. Hence the rate liming step is crucial to obtain the overall experimental rate law.
