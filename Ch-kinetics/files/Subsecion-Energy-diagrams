Energy profile, or energy diagrams, are a visual representation of the advancing of a reaction (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-energy-diagram1}). Reactions advance through changes in the geometry of the reaction and during a reaction, for example, some bonds are being formed while others are being broken.
The horizontal axis of the diagram represents the reaction coordinate, representing how the reaction proceeds, from reactants on the left to products on the right. The vertical axis represents the energy, oftentimes the enthalpy of the different steps of the reaction. Transitions states are maxima in the energy diagrams, that is, points between two minima connecting reactants and products.

We can extract two types pf properties from energy diagrams. First, the reaction energy $\Delta H_R$ is the difference in energy between the products and reactants. If this value is negative, the reaction will be exothermic, releasing heat. The opposite is true for an endothermic reaction that consumes heat. Second, we can obtain the activation energy as the energy of the transition state with respect to the energy of the reactants. The activation energy will always be a positive number which value is related with the reaction rate: in general small activation energies lead to fast reactions and large activation energies lead to slow reactions. Below are two examples showing an exothermic and endothermic reactions, as well as a diagram showing the activation energy.
