This previous example was useful to obtain the rate law using data involving only the concentration of one reactant. In other words, the previous example was useful to obtain simple rate law such as:
\[r=k[A]^x\]
The next example will cover how to calculate the rate law when the data provided involved the concentration of two reactants and therefore the rate law contains the orders of two species. In other words, the next example will show how to obtain more complex rate laws such as:
\[r=k[A]^x[B]^y\]
in which we do not know the reaction constant and two of the order.
