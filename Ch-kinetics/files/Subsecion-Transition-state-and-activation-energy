We have discussed that the energy of reactants is a key parameter during a reaction. The minimum energy needed to activate the reactants so that they can produce products is called activation energy. The higher the activation energy the more energy is needed for a reaction to happen and hence the lower the reaction rate will be. When reactants get together they increase their energy from reactants until a state of maximum energy before producing the products. This state of maximum energy is called an activated complex or transition state. Transition states are very ephemeral states that exist for a very short amount of time in comparison to reactants and products. An example of activation happens during the ignition of a gas burner. Cooking gas and oxygen can react together to produce water and carbon dioxide only with the help of a spark. A spark is needed to activate the reactants so that their molecules can reach the transition state and hence produce products. Transition states are normally indicated with a $\ddag$  sign to indicate they have a very different nature than normal molecules. The figure below represents two reaction pathways with different activation energy.
