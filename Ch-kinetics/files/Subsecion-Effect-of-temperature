As temperature increases the kinetic energy of the molecules reacting increases as well and with this the energy involved in the collisions also increases. Molecules move faster at higher temperature and hence the frequency of collisions between reactants and molecules increases with temperature. Overall, the reaction rate increases with temperature. In other words, we can speed up chemical reactions by increasing temperature.
