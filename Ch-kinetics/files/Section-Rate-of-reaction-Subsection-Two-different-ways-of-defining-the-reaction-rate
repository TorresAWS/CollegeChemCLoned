When a chemical reaction proceeds, reactants decompose into products. Therefore, the concentration of reactants decreases with time as reactant molecules become products, and the concentration of products increases with time as products are being formed. This change in concentration with time is what we call reaction rate. There are two different ways of defining the rate of a reaction. We can define the average reaction rate $\overline{r}$ as the change in concentration with time or as an instantaneous rate $r$ when the time interval is very small (we call this derivative):

Both types of rates are not numerically the same. The average rate is an average change in concentration between two different times. At the same time, the time interval for the average can be large or small.
Differently, the instantaneous rate is calculated as the slope in the concentration vs. time plot at a given time--using mathematical terms we call this the derivative. Instantaneous rates represent more accurately the changes in concentration happening in a reaction. For this reason, from now on, whenever we describe a reaction rate we will refer to the instantaneous rate.
