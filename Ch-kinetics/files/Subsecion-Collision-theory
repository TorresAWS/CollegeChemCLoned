Chemical reactions proceed at a molecular level by means of the collision of reactant molecules. The frequency of collisions is directly related to the reaction rate so that the more collisions per second the faster the reaction would proceed as the higher would be the chance for a reaction to occur. The collision theory of the chemical reactions associates the rate to the frequency of collisions. By increasing the concentration of reactants the number of collisions would increase and that is the reason why there is a concentration dependency on the reaction rate. However, not all collisions are equally effective and only effective collisions will contribute to chemical reactions. Two main factors control the effectiveness of the molecular collisions. First, the orientation of the collisions is critical and only certain orientations will produce successful collisions. The second factor is the energy of the molecules colliding. Only molecules with energy beyond a threshold will be able to form products. In other words: a successful collision should have the right orientation while having enough energy. Let us elaborate on the role of the orientation for the reaction:
\begin{center}\ce{Cl + NOCl -> Cl2 + NO}\end{center}
We have that a Cl atom reacts with a \ce{NOCl} molecule to produce \ce{Cl2}, as represented in the image below. Only with the Cl atoms hit the \ce{NOCl} molecule through the Cl atom, the collision will proceed with the right orientation in order to produce the \ce{Cl2} molecule. At the same time, if the orientation is correct and the molecules have enough energy a transition state will form. We will discuss more this state during the next sections.
