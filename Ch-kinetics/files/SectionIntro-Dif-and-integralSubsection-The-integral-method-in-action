Now we are ready to work from scratch on a set of data from the integral method. Normally, data involving concentration and time will be given. To apply the integral method, we need to process these data into three different columns, reporting the concentration, the logarithm of the concentration, and the inverse of the concentration. Next, we will do three plots and we will obtain the regression line for each plot. We will compare the goodness of the fit by assessing the value of $r^2$. The closer this value to one the better the fit. This analysis will lead to the reaction order. Finally, after we have selected the plot that corresponds to the best fit, we will analyze the regression line and extract the rate constant and initial molarity of reactants.
