The rate law is an experimental expression, a formula that comes from an experiment, relating the rate of reaction with the concentration of the chemicals that impact the rate. An example of a rate law would be:
\[r=k[\ce{NO}]^2[\ce{O2}]\]
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $r$   is the overall rate of reaction
  \item $k$ is the rate constant 
 \item $[\ce{NO}]$  is the molarity of \ce{NO}
  \item $[\ce{O2}]$  is the molarity of \ce{O2}
\end{where}
So, what is the purpose of a rate law? Let us use the following rate law as an example:
\[r=0.002[\ce{NO}]^2[\ce{O2}]\]
By means of the rate law above, we can compute the numerical value of the rate of reaction for different concentrations. As such, rate laws help predict the value of the reaction rate.
