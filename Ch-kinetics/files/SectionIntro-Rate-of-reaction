Some chemical reactions are fast such as the explosive reaction between cooking gas and oxygen, happening almost instantaneously. Other reactions are slow such as the rusting of iron, taking months to occur. Chemical kinetics is a chemistry discipline that studies the speed of chemical reactions and the factors that affect this measure. The overall goal here is to understand the factors that control the rate of reactions with the ultimate goal of maximizing the generation of products. This section covers the principles of reaction rates, defining two different types of rates, and showing how to interconvert rates of reaction.
