Up to now, we analyzed the importance of using rate laws. However, before this point, all rate laws were given. This section will cover how to experimentally obtain rate laws by analyzing experimental data. There are two main methods for obtaining rate laws: the differential method and the integral method and each method differs not only on the nature of the experimental data gathered but also on how this data is processed.
