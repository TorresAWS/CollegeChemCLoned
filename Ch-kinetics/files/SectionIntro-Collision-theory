The rate of reaction depends on temperature and reaction proceed at a higher speed at higher temperatures. This is the reason we use refrigerators and freezers to keep food for a longer time. The collision theory is a kinetics theory that provides a microscopic understanding of chemical reactions. A pivotal element of this theory is the transition state also called the activated complex. This is an ephemeral state between reactants and products so that if the reaction proceeds until this point, reactants will certainly evolve into products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state of a reaction is called the activation energy. Energy diagrams are useful representations of the energy changes involved in a reaction. By analyzing an energy diagram we can predict whether a reaction is endo of exothermic and estimate the energy involved in the activation of a reaction. This section covers the fundamental principles of collision theory and introduces the interpretation of energy diagrams.
