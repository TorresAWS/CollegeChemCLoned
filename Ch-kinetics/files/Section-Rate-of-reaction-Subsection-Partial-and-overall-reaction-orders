The powers in the rate law are called reaction order. For example, in the rate law below
\[r=k[\ce{NO}]^2[\ce{O2}]\]
the order of \ce{NO} is $2$ as the power of \ce{NO} in the rate law is 2. Similarly, the partial order of \ce{O2} is $1$ as the power of \ce{O2} in the rate law is 1. The overall reaction order it 3, and this number results in adding all partial orders. Regarding the way we describe the reaction order, if the reaction order is one, we would say that the reaction is first order. Similarly, if the reaction order is two, we would say the reaction is second order, and so on. The reaction order can also be zero when the power in the rate law is zero. Reaction orders tend to be integer numbers such as 0, 1, or 2, mostly in educational problems. However, using realistic kinetic data, the partial and total orders can be any number and even have a negative sign. The reaction orders are very important as they indicate how the reaction rate responds to changes in concentration. For example, using the rate law above, if we double the concentration of \ce{O2} the rate law will double, but if we double the concentration of \ce{NO}, the reaction rate would quadruple, that is, it would be four times larger.
