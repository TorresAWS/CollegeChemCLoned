Some chemical reactions double their rate by increasing the concentration of reactants, whereas, for the same change of concentration, others quadruple their rate. The rate law of a reaction is an experimental formula that explicitly includes the power dependence of the rate of reaction on the concentration of reactants and products. You can find rate laws in a differential form and in an integrated form. 
 On one hand, the differential rate law, or simply the rate law, is convenient when we want to assess the impact of concentration on the rate of reaction. On the other hand, integral rate laws give the time dependency of the concentration, being convenient to track how the reactants disappear with time. This section will cover how to interpret rate laws and how to differentiate rate laws from integral rate laws. It will also introduce the concept of the partial and the total order of reaction, as well as the idea of reaction rate constant.
