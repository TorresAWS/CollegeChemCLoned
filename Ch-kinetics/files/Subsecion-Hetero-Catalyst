A heterogeneous catalyst is a material with catalytic properties which has a different state of matter than the main reaction. For example, the synthesis of ammonia is carried in the chemical industry by means of reacting has hydrogen and nitrogen. The catalyst for this process is iron, which is a solid. The reaction proceeds in a gas phase, whereas the catalyst employed is solid. This is an example of heterogeneous catalysis. Another example of the hydrogenation of alkenes by means of molecular hydrogen. This process is used for example in the production of saturated fats or shortenings such as Crisco. As hydrogen hardly dissociates in gas, this reaction proceeds at a very low rate without the help of a catalyst. Differently, in the presence of platinum, the dissociation energy of hydrogen is lower what makes the process function at a faster rate. 
The necessary steps for a reaction to happen on a heterogeneous catalyst are: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  the adsorption of the reactants on the surface (the words adsorption refers to the attachment of a gas onto a solid)
\item  the activation of the reactants in which its molecular geometry changes due to the adsorption 
\item  the migration of the adsorbed reactants
\item  the surface reaction
\item  the desorption of the products
\end{inparaenum}
