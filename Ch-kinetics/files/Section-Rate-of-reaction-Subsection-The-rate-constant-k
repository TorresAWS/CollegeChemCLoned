The rate constant is a critical parameter of a rate law as it tells how the reaction responds to changes on molarity. For example, look this two different rate laws:
\[r_A=0.01[\ce{N2O5}]\quad\quad \text{ and } \quad\quad r_B=0.001[\ce{N2O5 }]\]
We have that as the rate constant in $r_A$ is larger the changes in the concentration of \ce{N2O5} will have a stronger impact on the rate than in  $r_B$.
