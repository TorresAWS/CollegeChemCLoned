We will practice the integral method by extracting the rate constant and the initial reactant concentration from the linear regression data. Linear regression software will give the equation of a line and the associated $r$ coefficient. We will have to read the slope and the intercept of the equation and infer the rate constant and the initial reactant concentration $[A]_0$.
The rate constant will be obtained from the slope of the line, whereas $[A]_0$ is related to the intercept.
For all cases, the absolute value of the slope of the line equation will correspond to the rate constant $k$. The relationship between $[A]_0$ and the intercept differs based on the order. For a zeroth-order plot, the intersect directly corresponds to the initial concentration. Differently, for a first-order reaction, the intercept corresponds to $Ln(\text{[A]}_0)$. Therefore, to obtain $[A]_0$ you will have to compute the exponential of the intersect: $[A]_0=\myexp{Intersect}$. Finally, for a second-order reaction, the slope will correspond to the inverse of the initial concentration, and hence, to obtain $[A]_0$ we will have to compute the inverse of the intersect: $[A]_0=\frac{1}{Intersect}$. The following example shows how to obtain the rate constant and $[A]_0$ using regression results.
