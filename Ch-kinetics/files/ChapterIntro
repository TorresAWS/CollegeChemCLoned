\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{he} rate at which a chemical reaction occurs is a critical parameter at an industrial and laboratory-level as the faster the speed the sooner one can commercialize or sell a given chemical product. Slow chemical reactions are, in general, less desirable as it takes more time for the reagents to react. On the other hand, too fast chemical reactions can also be less desirable. Think, for example, in an explosion in which gas and a spark quickly generate carbon dioxide with water and a lot of heat in a way that is not easy to control. This chapter deals with the rate of reactions. You will learn how to calculate what we call a rate law which is a mathematical formula that gives the numerical rate value. You will also learn the collision theory that explains the factors that affect the speed of chemical reactions.
