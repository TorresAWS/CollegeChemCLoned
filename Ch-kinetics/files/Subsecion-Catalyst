Catalysts are chemicals that are not directly involved in a reaction--they are neither reactants nor products and as such, they are not consumed during a reaction. Still, they have the ability to increase the rate of reactions. 
Each catalyst is specific to a given reaction. As such, a catalyst can speed up a reaction without affecting other reactions. Enzymes are biological catalysts that support chemical reactions happening in the body. Most of the biological reactions involved in the chemistry of life are very slow. It is only with the help of biological catalysts that these reactions can indeed happen at reasonable rates. Every single metabolic reaction has associated an enzyme responsible for speeding up the process. Similarly, catalysts are well-known compounds in the chemical industry. The production of chemicals in the industry is also supported by the help of catalysts which make the chemical processes more economically beneficial. For example, catalysts are used in the manufacturing of margarine from vegetable oils. In the same line, the synthesis of ammonia is catalyzed by iron,  the manufacturing of sulfuric acid uses catalysts based on nitrogen(II) oxide and platinum, and the oxidation of hydrocarbons in automobile exhausts are catalyzed by platinum. Enzymes are also added to detergents in order to speed up the breaking of protein molecules in stains.
How do catalysts work? Catalyst function by providing alternative reaction pathways with more favorable--normally lower--activation energy. This way, in the presence of a catalyst, reactions proceed by means of two different reaction pathways, the catalyzed and non-catalyzed pathways. Still, as the catalyzed pathway is more favorable the overall speed of the reaction is higher. 
Catalysts can be classified as homogeneous, heterogeneous, and acid catalysts.
