The integral method is used to calculate the rate law if data reporting concentration and time are given. To understand the use of the integral method, it is convenient to learn more about integral rate laws. Let us analyze the integral rate law for a zeroth-order reaction:
\[[\ce{A}] =-k\cdot t + [\ce{A}]_0\]
If you look carefully you could notice that this integral rate law is indeed a linear relationship. The term $[\ce{A}]_0$  and $k$ are constants. Differently, the terms $\ce{A}]$ and $t$ are variables. Linear relationships are mathematical relationships with an independent variable represented in the horizontal axes and a dependent variable represented in the vertical axis. In the rate law above the independent variable is $t$ and the dependent variable is $[\ce{A}]$ and for every value of $t$ we would have a given value of $[\ce{A}]$. Moreover, $-k$ is the slope of the relationship, and $[\ce{A}]_0$ is the intersect. Let us analyze another integral rate law, this time for a first-order reaction:
\[\text{Ln}[\ce{A}]=-k\cdot t+\text{Ln}[\ce{A}]_0\]
we have that this law also represent a linear relationship as well, with $t$ as independent variable (the $x$) and $Ln([\ce{A}])$ as the dependent variable (the $y$). The slope is $-k$ and the intersect is $Ln([\ce{A}]_0)$. Overall, we have that all integral rate laws are linear relationship with $t$ as the $x$ and different properties as the $y$:  $[\ce{A}]$ for a zeroth-order, $Ln([\ce{A}])$ for a first-order reaction and $\frac{1}{[\ce{A}]}$ for a second-order reaction. We also have that the slope of the lines in absolute value always gives $k$. This information is summarized in Table \ref{tab:Table-the-integral-method}.


The integral method is based on plotting some kinetic data, for example, concentration vs. time, and fitting the data into a linear relationship.
If the quality of the fit is good enough, by reading the slope of the line and the intersect one can compute the rate law that rules the reaction.
To associate the experimental data into a line we use linear regression, a statistical tool that gives the equation of the best line that fits the experimental data. At the same time, linear regression gives an estimate of the goodness of the fit through a regression parameter, $r$ or $r^2$, depending on the statistics software employed.
Overall, is good to keep in mind that every plot ($[A]$ vs. t, Ln$[A]$ vs. t or $1/[A]$ vs. t) is associated to a specific order.
