Calculate
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]	
\item The energy of the reactants
\item	 The energy of the products
\item	 The energy of the transition state
\item	 The activation energy
\item	 The reaction energy  
\item	 Indicate whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic
\end{inparaenum} \\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
We have that the energy of the reactants is -15kJ/mol, the energy of the products is -25kJ/mol and the energy of the transition state (TS) is -5kJ/mol. The reaction energy represents the energy of the products concerning the reactants: $-25 - (-15)=-10$kJ/mol. This is an exothermic reaction. The activation energy represents the energy of the TS concerning the reactants: $-5 - (-15)=10$kJ/mol. \\
