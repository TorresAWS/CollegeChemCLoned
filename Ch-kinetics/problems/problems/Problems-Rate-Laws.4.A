Identify the following rate laws as integral or differential, and given a form obtain the corresponding other type of from (i.e. if the integral from is given then obtain the differential form)
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item $[\ce{A}] =0.045 -0.34\cdot t $	 	%	(integral, $r=0.34$, $[A]_0$=0.045)
\item 	   $r=0.9[A]^1$, $[A]_0$=1.49   %	(differential, $Ln([\ce{A}])=0.4 -0.9\cdot t$)
\item $\frac{1}{[\ce{A}]}=0.3+0.04\cdot t $	%	(integral, $r=0.04[A]^2$, $[A]_0$=3.33)
\end{inparaenum}
