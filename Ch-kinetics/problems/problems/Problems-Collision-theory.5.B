For the decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide
 \begin{center}\ce{2N2O5_{(g)} -> 2N2O4_{(g)} + O2_{(g)}	 		}\end{center}
the rate constant at 500K is 345.43 s$^{-1}$ and at different temperature, the rate constant is 24.84 s$^{-1}$. Given that the activation energy of this reaction is 103.03 kJ/mol, calculate the second temperature value.
