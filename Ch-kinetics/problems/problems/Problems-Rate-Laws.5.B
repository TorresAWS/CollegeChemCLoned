Compute the half-life for the following reactions:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item a first order reaction with $k$=0.234 1/s	 	%	(2.96s)
\item a zeroth-order reaction with $k$=0.34 M/s	 and initial concentration 0.1M	%	(0.15 s)
\item a second-order reaction with $k$=0.067 M/s	 and initial concentration 0.01M	%	(1492 s)
\end{inparaenum}
