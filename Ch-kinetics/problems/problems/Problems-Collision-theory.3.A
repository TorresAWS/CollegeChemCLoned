The reaction energy of a process, going from reactants into products, is 10kJ/mol and its activation energy is 15kJ/mol. Calculate the reaction energy and the activation energy of the reverse process, starting from products and going to reactants. Is the direct reaction exothermic or endothermic. How about the reverse process?
