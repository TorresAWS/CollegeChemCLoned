Given the following rate law
\begin{center}$r$=0.4[\ce{Cl2}][\ce{F2}]$^2$\end{center}
indicate:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  the reaction order of \ce{Cl2}  % (first order)
\item  the reaction order of \ce{F2}  % (second order)
\item  the overall reaction order% (third order)
\item  the value of the reaction constant including its units  % (0.4 s/M$^2$)
\end{inparaenum}
