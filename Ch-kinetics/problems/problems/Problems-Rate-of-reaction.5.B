For the reaction below: \ce{2a	+	3b	->	4c	+	5d }
and given that the rate of disappearance of b is $r_B$=-0.3M/s, calculate:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  the rate of disappearance of A, $r_A$   % (- 0.2M/s)
\item  the rate of appearance of C, $r_C$   % (+0.4M/s )
\item  the rate of appearance of D, $r_D$   % (+0.5M/s )
\item  the rate of reaction $r$   % (0.1M/s )
\end{inparaenum}
