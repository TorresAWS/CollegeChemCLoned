For the gas-phase reaction between hydrogen and iodine
 \begin{center}\ce{H2_{(g)}  + I2_{(g)} -> 2HI_{(g)} 		}\end{center}
the rate constant at 500K was found to be $9.36\times 10^{-7}$ 1/(M$\cdot$s) and the rate constant at 600K was found to be $5.69\times 10^{-4}$ 1/(M$\cdot$s). Calculate the activation energy in kJ/mol and the frequency factor of the reaction.
