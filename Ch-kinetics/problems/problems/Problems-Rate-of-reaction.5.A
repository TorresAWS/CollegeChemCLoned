For the reaction below: \ce{2a	+	2b -> 3c	+	d            }
and given that the rate of appearance of d is $r_D$=0.2M/s, calculate:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  the rate of disappearance of A, $r_A$   % (- 0.4M/s)
\item  the rate of disappearance of B, $r_B$   % (- 0.4M/s)
\item  the rate of appearance of C, $r_C$   % (+0.6M/s )
\item  the rate of reaction $r$   % (0.2M/s )
\end{inparaenum}
