For a given reaction the differential rate is measured for a set of species. Given the numerical values indicated next, identify the specie as reactant or product:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item  $r_A$=0.3M/s  % (product)
\item  $r_B$=-0.1M/s  % (reactant)
\item  $r_C$=-1.2M/s  % (reactant)
\item  $r_D$=0.6M/s  % (product)
\end{inparaenum}
