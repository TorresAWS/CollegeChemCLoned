Oxygen is collected over water in the decomposition of potassium chlorate:
\begin{center}\ce{2KClO3_{(s)} -> 2KCl_{(s)} + 3O2_{(g)}}\end{center}
Given that 10mL of gas are collected at 35$^{\circ}$C at a pressure of 0.5atm, and that the vapor pressure of water at that temperature is 0.0555 atm, calculate the number of moles of \ce{KClO3} decomposed.

 Answer: $1.2\times 10^{-4}$ moles of \ce{KClO3}. \end{flushright} }
