Phosphorus reacts with oxygen gas to produce tetraphosphorus decaoxide according to the following equation:
\begin{center}\ce{  P4(s)  + $\underset{\text{\large 2L}}{5\ce{O2(g)   }}$  -> $\underset{\text{\large x mol}}{\ce{P4O10(g)}}$  } \end{center}
Calculate the number of moles of phosphorus that react with 2L of oxygen at STP conditions.
