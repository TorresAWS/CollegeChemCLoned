Until now we have discussed ideal gases. These simplistic representations of gases represent very dilute gases in which the gas particles are apart. The particles of an ideal gas are also considered to be very minute without a volume. At the same time, the collisions between the particles and the walls of the container are elastic--this means the molecules do not lose any energy. As you can imagine, no gas is an ideal gas, as this is just an ideal model. This section will cover the properties of real gases, in which the gas particles interact among themselves and the collisions are inelastic and energy is lost.
