\newstep[] Set a 400mL beaker on a hot plate and use an iron ring to secure it.
\newstep[] Obtain a 125mL Erlenmeyer flask and make sure it is dry inside.
\newstep[] In the neck of the flask, place a rubber stopper containing tubing and a pinch clamp.
\newstep[] Leave the pinch clamp open.
\newstep[] Use a clamp to secure the flask to a ring stand.
\newstep[] Set a 400mL beaker on a hot plate and use an iron ring to secure it. Place the flask inside the beaker without touching the bottom of the beaker.
\newstep[] Add water to the beaker until it reaches the neck of the flask but without reaching the rim of the beaker.
\newstep[] Begin boiling the water in the beaker, and boil gently for 10 min so that the temperature of water equilibrates with the temperature of the air inside the flask.
\newstep[] Measure and record in the Results section the temperature of the boiling water.

\end{steps}

\subsection*{Charle's Law: cooling down the gas}\begin{steps}
\newstep[] Remove the flask from the hot plate and close the pinch clamp. Under any circumstance close the pinch while the flask is submerged in hot water.

\newstep[] Undo the clamp that secures the flask to the ring stand and use it as handle to carefully lift the flask out of the boiling water.
\newstep[] Quickly place the flask with the flask-handle inside a large container with cold water while keeping the stopper-end of the flask pointing downward.
\newstep[] Keeping the stopper-end of the flask downward, open the pinch-clamp while keeping the flask submerged.
\newstep[] At this point, water will start entering the flask, decreasing the volume of air inside the flask. Keep the flask submerged for 10 minutes. At this point the temperature of the cool water-bath will be the same as the temperature inside the flask.
\newstep[] Keeping the flask upside down rise or lower the flask until the water level inside the flask is equal to the water level of the large water container. This process equalizes the pressure inside the flask with the atmospheric pressure. At this point, close the pinch clamp. Now you can remove the flask from the large water container.
\newstep[] Measure and record in the Results section the temperature of the large water container.
\newstep[] Measure and record in the Results section the amount of liquid that entered the flask by pouring the water into a measuring cylinder.
\newstep[] Dry very well the flask, and repeat the procedure described above two more times.
\end{steps}
\subsection*{Charle's Law: flask volume}\begin{steps}
\newstep[] Now you are going to measure and record in the Results section the total volume of the flask (mind this is not the volume indicated in the flask). 
\newstep[] Fill completely the flask with water until its rim, and then pouring this water into a large-enough measuring cylinder.
\newstep[]  Plot the values of the gas volume (vertical axis) and temperature (horizontal axis). The results should give a straight line. Draw a smooth line through the data points.

    \subsection*{Boyle's Law}\begin{steps}
\newstep[] This miniexperiment provides values of pressure and volume of a gas at fixed temperature. You will have to process these data. 

\newstep[]  Multiply the pressure and volume values and report the resulting values in the results section.
\newstep[]  Plot the values of pressure (vertical axis) and volume (horizontal axis). The results should give a slight curve (not a straight line). Draw a smooth line through the data points.

\section*{Calculations}
\mycircled{1} This is the volume of the flask obtained by filling the flask completely with water and then displacing the liquid into a cylinder.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{2} These are the temperature $T$ in Kelvin of the hot and cold baths.\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{3} These are the volume of water displaced into the flask, $V_{liquid}$. \vspace{0.5cm}\\
\mycircled{4} These values are the volume of gas in the flask, $V_{gas}$:
    \[V_{gas}= \;\;\mycircled{1}\;\; - \;\;\mycircled{3}\;\; \]
\mycircled{5} Divide the gas volume by its temperature:\vspace{0.5cm}\\
    \[ \frac{V_{gas}}{T}=\frac{\;\;\mycircled{4}\;\;}{\;\;\mycircled{2}\;\;}  \]
