\item[\docfilehook{Molar volume}{}] 
If we work at STP conditions the volume of one mole of gas equals to 22.4L, and we refer to this relationship as the molar volume.%\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1}{Add this relation into your flashcard.}
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  \frac{1 \text{mol}} {22.4\text{ L at STP}} } \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Molar Volume}}
\end{equation*}
This relationship allows us to carry stoichiometric calculations in chemical reaction involving gases.
