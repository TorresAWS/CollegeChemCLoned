Gases have different properties compared to solids or liquids:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Gases assume the volume and shape of their container. As they expand, they have no shape different than their container's shape.
\item Gases are compressible: they can be compressed, reducing their volume. Differently, liquids and solids are incompressible.
\item  The density of gases is small, compared to the one for solids and liquids.
\end{itemize}
