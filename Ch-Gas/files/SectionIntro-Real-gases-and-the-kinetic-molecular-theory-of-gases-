\section{Real gases and the kinetic molecular theory of gases }
Until now we have discusses ideal gases. Ideal gases represent very diluted gases in which the gas particles do not see each other, as they are apart. The particles of an ideal gas are very minute without a volume. The collisions between the particles and the walls of the container are elastic--this means the gas molecules do not loose any energy. As you can imagine, no gas is an ideal gas, as this is just an ideal model. This section will cover the properties of real gases, in which the gas particles interact among themselves. We will also discuss the kinetic molecular theory with a particular emphasis on particle average velocity--this is technically called root mean square velocity, $v_{RMS}$.
