The root means square velocity $v_{RMS}$ is just an average of the square velocities of the gas particles. Still, some particles will have faster velocity than $v_{RMS}$, and others will have slower velocity. The molecular velocities of the particles of gas follow a distribution that is mass and temperature dependent. 
As shown in Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter}, the higher temperature the larger the root square velocity, with a wider distribution of velocities. At the same time, the larger the molar mass of the gas, the smaller the root square velocity with a thinner distribution of velocities.
