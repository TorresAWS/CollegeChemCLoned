\item[\docfilehook{Distribution of velocities}{}] 
The root mean square velocity $v_{RMS}$ is just an average of the square velocities of the gas particles. Still, some particles will have faster velocity than $v_{RMS}$ and other will have slower velocity. The molecular velocities of the particles of a gas follow a distribution which is mass and temperature dependent. 
As shown in Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter} , the higher temperature the larger the root square velocity, with a wider distribution of velocities. At the same time, the larger the molar mass of the gas, the smaller the root square velocity with a thiner distribution of velocities.
