\item[\docfilehook{Mole fraction}{}] 
The mole fraction ($X_A$) of a gas (A) in a mixture of gas is just the number of moles of this gas over the total number of moles in the mixture. The larger the mole fraction of a gas in a mixture the more molecules of that specific gas are there in the mixture with respect to all components. One can express the morel fraction in terms of partial pressures also, as the pressure of a given gas over the total pressure. For a mixture with $n$ components:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  X_A = \frac{n_A}{n_A + n_B + \dots + n_n}\;\; \;    or\;\; \;   \frac{p_A}{p_A + p_B + \dots + p_n} }
\end{equation*}
For a mixture of gases, the partial pressure of a gas ($p_A$) is related to the mole fraction of that gas ($X_A$) and the total pressure of the mixture of gases ($P_{Total}$):
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  p_A=X_A\cdot P_{Total}}
\end{equation*}
