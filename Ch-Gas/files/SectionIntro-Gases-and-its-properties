Gases contain atomic or molecular particles. They have very different properties than liquids or solids. The particles of a gas are spread and far away from each other. Liquids, on the other hand, are made of loose particles that interact through weak forces. Solids, on the other hand, are packed materials, and their particles, atoms, or molecules, are closer together. This section covers the different properties of gases.
