The air is a mixture of different gases. It contains oxygen (\ce{O2}) and nitrogen (\ce{N2}) as well as other gases such as carbon dioxide, argon, or water vapor. Only 21\% of the air is made of oxygen and 78.2\% of nitrogen. The other gases represent 0.8\% of the air. The atmospheric pressure is 1 atm and results from the pressure of all the components of the air. Each gas exerts a partial pressure and all combined exert the total atmospheric pressure. In this section, you will learn how to work with mixtures of gases. This section also covers the use of the molar volume to relate moles and volume at standard conditions.
