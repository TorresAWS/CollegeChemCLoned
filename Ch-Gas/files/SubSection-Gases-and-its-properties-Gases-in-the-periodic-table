Some of the elements in the periodic table are molecular gases, resulting from the combination of two atoms of the same element. For example, molecular oxygen (\ce{O2}) is a gas. Similarly, molecular nitrogen (\ce{N2}), molecular hydrogen (\ce{H2}), molecular chlorine (\ce{Cl2}), or molecular fluorine (\ce{F2}) are all diatomic gases--they contain two atoms of the same element. Other gases result from the combination of two different non-metals. Examples are carbon monoxide (\ce{CO}) or dioxide (\ce{CO2}), and nitrogen monoxide (\ce{NO}) or dioxide (\ce{NO2}). The noble gases (Ne, He, Ar) also exist in the gas state.
