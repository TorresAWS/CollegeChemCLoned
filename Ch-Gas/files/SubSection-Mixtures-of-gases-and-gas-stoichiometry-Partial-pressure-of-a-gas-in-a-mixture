\item[\docfilehook{Partial pressure of a gas in a mixture}{ }] 
For a mixture with different gases, the partial pressure of a given gas ($A$) will depend on the number of moles of that particular gas and the overall volume of the mixture
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{  p_A = \frac{n_A RT }{V }    }
\end{equation*}
