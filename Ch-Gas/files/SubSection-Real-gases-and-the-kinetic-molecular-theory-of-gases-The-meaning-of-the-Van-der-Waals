\item[\docfilehook{The meaning of the Van der Waals constants}{}] 
There are two Van der Waals constants: $a$ and $b$ (see Table  \ref{tab:{\chapterlabel}\thetablenewcounter}). The Van der Waals constant $a$ represent the degree of interaction between the molecules of a gas. The larger these values the more interactions exists between the gas particles. For example, for \ce{He} we have $a=$ 0.0341$\text{atm}\cdot \text{L}^2/\text{mol}^{2}$, whereas for \ce{H2O} we have $a=$ 5.46 $\text{atm}\cdot \text{L}^2/\text{mol}^{2}$. Comparing the values of $a$ for both gases, we can conclude that the interaction between the particles of \ce{He} are very weak and in contrast, the interactions between the particles of \ce{H2O} are stronger. The Van der Waals constant $b$ is related to the molecular size, however, the relationship is not as straightforward as in the case of the $a$ constant.
