\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{black!45}T}{he} air we all breath contains numerous gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Some of these gases are indeed essential for life. As an example, plants take up carbon dioxide to give off oxygen, and water is produced by the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen gas. Other gases are dangerous for life. An example is carbon monoxide, which results from gas stoves, heating systems and fire. This is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can bind to the blood displacing oxygen. As a consequence, carbon monoxide can build up in closed environments causing death. This chapter deals with the properties of gases. You will learn how to calculate the volume or pressure of a gas, characterizing its state. You will also learn how to work with mixtures of gases and for example predict the pressure of oxygen in an atmosphere containing numerous gases.
