If temperature and the number of moles of a gas are kept constant the product of pressure and volume will remain constant too. This is the case of the balloon-pressing example. We call this Boyle's Law:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{ \frac{P} {V}=c \quad or \quad   P_1\cdot V_1=P_2\cdot V_2} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Boyle's law}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P_1, V_1$   are the initial pressure and volume
 \item $P_2, V_2$   are the final pressure and volume
  \item $c$   is a constant
\end{where}

\item[\docfilehook{Volume-Temperature change}{}] 
Imagine you cool down a balloon at fixed pressure (under the atmosphere). What would happen to the balloon's volume? Based on Charle's law, its volume will decrease:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\frac{V} {T}=c \quad or \quad   \frac{V_1} {T_1}=\frac{V_2} {T_2}} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Charle's law}}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $V_1, T_1$   are the initial volume and temperature
 \item $V_2, T_2$   are the final volume and temperature
   \item $c$   is a constant
\end{where}
