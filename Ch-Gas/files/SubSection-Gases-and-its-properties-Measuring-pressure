Two different devices are used to measure pressure, barometers, and manometers. Barometers are used to measure specifically the atmospheric pressure and historically, they consist of a glass tube filled with mercury (\ce{Hg}), inverted on a plate containing more mercury. At sea level, the height of the mercury columns should be close to 760mmHg.
Manometers, on the other hand, are used to measure the pressure of any gas. Manometers consist of a u-shaped tube filled with mercury. There are two types of manometers: open-tube and closed-tube manometers.
The pressure exerted by a gas changes the level of mercury on both sides of the tube and the height difference measured as the right minus the left side ($\Delta h=h_{right}-h_{left}$) is related to the gas pressure. For closed-tube manometers--normally used to measure pressure below the atmospheric pressure--when the gas pressure increases the left column of the barometer is reduced and the right column increases. The difference between both columns is related to the gas pressure through:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{   \text{P}^{closed}=\text{hdg}} \quad\quad\quad  \boxed{ \text{P}^{open}=\text{hdg}+\text{P}_{atm}}    
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item P   is the pressure of the gas in Pa
\item $\Delta$h is the height difference in m, measured as $h_{right}-h_{left}$
 \item d   is the density of mercury 13593 kg/$\text{m}^3$
\item g   is gravity, 9.8 m/$\text{s}^2$
\item $\text{P}_{atm}$   is the atmospheric pressure close to 101325 Pa
\end{where}

For the open-tube manometer, normally used to measure pressure above the atmospheric pressure, we need to take into account the atmospheric pressure to the gas pressure. For this type of manometer, if the left column is below the right column ($\Delta h=h_{right}-h_{left}<0$), this means that the pressure in the gas is below the atmospheric pressure.

The atmosphere is made of oxygen (21\%), nitrogen (78\%) as well as other minor gases (1\%). These particles exhibit a pressure on us called atmospheric pressure. This pressure changes with altitude and with the weather. On a hot day, the column of air on top of us has more particles, and pressure increases. On a rainy day, the atmospheric pressure exerts less pressure. Above the sea level or at high altitudes the atmospheric pressure is less than 760 mmHg. For example, at mount Everest, the atmospheric pressure can be as low as 253 mmHg.
