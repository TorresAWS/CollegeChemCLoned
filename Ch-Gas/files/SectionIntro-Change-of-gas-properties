\section{Change of gas properties}
The previous section addressed the properties of an ideal gas.  However, as all properties of a gas are related, if we modify one the others will change too. This section covers situations in which one of the gas properties changes (e.g. V changes) and you need to predict the change of another gas property (e.g. P). For example, imagine you compress a balloon with your hand. The temperature and number of moles of the gas inside the balloon are constant, as the balloon is closed and in contact with the atmosphere. Differently, the pressure and volume will change. In particular, the volume will decrease and the pressure will increase. This means that the gas particles will hit the balloon harder and with more frequency.
