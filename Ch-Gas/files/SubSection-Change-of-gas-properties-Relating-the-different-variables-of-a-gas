The question is now if we increase the pressure at a fixed number of moles and pressure, how do we know if the volume will increase or perhaps decrease? Similarly, if for example, the number of gas moles increases at fixed pressure and volume, will the temperature of the gas increase or perhaps decrease? We can answer these questions by employing the ideal gas law. If the variables that we need to relate are on the same side of the equation (e.g. P and V) then if one of the variables increases the other will decrease. Differently, If the gas variables to relate are located on opposite sides of the gas law (e.g. P and T) then both will change in the same direction. For example, let us consider the changes of P and V (at fixed n and T). As they are on the same side of the ideal gas law ($\textcolor{dgreen}{PV}=nRT$) if P increases V will decrease. Differently, for the change of P and T (at fixed V and n), as both variables are on opposite sides of the ideal gas law ($\textcolor{dgreen}PV=nR\textcolor{dgreen}T$), if P increases, T will increase as well.
