The ideal gas law says:%\resizeableyellownote{2.5}{1}{Add this formula to your flashcard.}
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\boxed{  PV=nRT} \quad \textcolor{blue}{\text{Ideal Gas Law}}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $P$   is the pressure of the gas in atm
\item $V$    is the volume of the gas in L 
 \item $n$   is the number of moles of the gas
\item $T$   is the temperature of the gas in K
\item $R$   is the constant of the gas $0.082\frac{\text{atm}\cdot \text{L}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{K}}$
\end{where}
Imagine for example that you inflate a balloon with your mouth, introducing air particles into the balloon.
While the number of particles inside the balloon grows, its volume will grow too. More particles will collide with the walls of the balloon and hence, the pressure inside the balloon will also increase.
