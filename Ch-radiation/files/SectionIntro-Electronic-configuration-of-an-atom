Atoms have in general many electrons. These electrons are arranged in the atom in a very specific way creating what we know as electronic structure. You want to think about the electronic configuration of an atom as a code that tells you the orbital location of each electron in the atom. In fact, there are two ways to present electronic configurations. One is called full electronic configuration (for example $1s^22s^1$) and the other one is called condensed electronic configuration (for example $[He]2s^1$). The full configuration display all orbitals in an atom, whereas the abbreviated only display the valence electrons--these electrons are less-tied to the nucleus--and the nobel gas core. At the same time, every orbital is characterized by a set of numbers--these are called quantum numbers. These numbers are not independent from each other and there are constrictions that relate the possible values of the quantum numbers. This section will show you how to construct electron configurations and how to extract quantum numbers from it.
