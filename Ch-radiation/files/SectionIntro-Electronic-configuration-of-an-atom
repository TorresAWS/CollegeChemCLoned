Atoms have in general many electrons. These electrons are arranged in the atom in a very specific way creating what we know as an electronic structure. You want to think about the electronic configuration of an atom as a code that tells you the orbital location of each electron in the atom. There are two ways to present electronic configurations. One is called full electronic configuration (for example $1s^22s^1$) and the other one is called condensed electronic configuration (for example $[He]2s^1$). The full configuration displays all orbitals in an atom, whereas the abbreviated configuration only displays the valence electrons--these electrons are less-tied to the nucleus--and the noble gas core. At the same time, every orbital is characterized by a set of numbers--these are called quantum numbers. These numbers are not independent of each other and some constrictions exist among the possible values of the quantum numbers. This section will show you how to construct electron configurations and how to extract quantum numbers from them.
