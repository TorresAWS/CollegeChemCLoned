Atoms combine by sharing or giving away electron density. The \emph{electronegativity} of an atom in a molecule is its ability to attract electron density in a bond. Imagine two people holding a pillow with their hands, with the pillow representing a pair of electrons. If one of the people is more electronegative it will pull the pillow closer to them--it will attract more electrons. Electronegativity is loosely related to other periodic properties such as ionization energy and electron affinity. Very electronegative atoms such as F has also a large (negative) electron affinity (easily accepts electrons) and ionization energy (do not ionize easily). There are different electronegativity scales, and the most well-known scale was developed by Linus Pauling. Electronegativity (EN) increases (the atom is more electronegative) when going up a group (column) of the table and when going across a period (row), from left to right of the table. Highly electronegative atoms are located on the top right part of the table, whereas highly electropositive atoms are located on the bottom left part of the table. EN is a relative concept, that is, the electronegativity of an atom can only be measured about another atom. When comparing the EN of I and F, we found that F is more electronegative as it is further up in the same group ($EN_{F}>EN_{I}$).
