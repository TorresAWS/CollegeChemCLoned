Following De Broglie's proposal that particles behave like waves under certain circumstances, particles, in particular, electrons were found to exhibit properties of a wave. The diffraction of electrons was achieved by Davidsson and Germer by directing a beam of electrons through a thin piece of gold foil creating a pattern similar to the diffraction of x-rays.
