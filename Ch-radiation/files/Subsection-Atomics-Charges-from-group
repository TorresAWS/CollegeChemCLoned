Most of the representative elements lose or gain electrons to achieve the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas. Therefore, one can obtain the ionic charges based on the group numbers. Elements belonging to Group 1A have an atomic charge of $1+$ and they will lose one electron to reach the corresponding noble gas electronic configuration. For example, the ionic charge of Li is $1+$. Mind we write $1+$ and not $+1$. The same is for groups 2A and 3A with ionic charges of $2+$ and $3+$, respectively. Elements belonging to Group 7A have an atomic charge of $-1$ and they will gain one electron to reach the corresponding noble gas electronic configuration. Same for groups 6A and 5A with ionic charges of $2-$ and $3-$, respectively. Elements in group 4A do not typically form ions and hence do not have an ionic charge.
