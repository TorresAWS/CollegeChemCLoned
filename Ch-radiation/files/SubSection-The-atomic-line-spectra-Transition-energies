Bohr's model can explain the atomic spectrum of hydrogen. Each line in the spectrum represents a transition between two levels of energy. For example, the line at 102nm represents the transition of an electron between level three and level one, we call this 3 $\rightarrow$ 1. The atomic spectrum of hydrogen is obtained using exciting hydrogen atoms with energy so that the electron jumps from a lower level to a higher level. When the atom relaxes, it emits light as the electrons move back from high levels into lower--more stable--levels. This is called emission. The different possible emissions have names based on the person who discovered them. For example, the set of emissions that end up in the fundamental level ($n$=1) is called the Lyman series. Similarly, the set of emissions that end up in the level ($n$=2) is called the Balmer series. For example 3 $\rightarrow$ 2, 4 $\rightarrow$ 2, or 5 $\rightarrow$ 2. Only the Balmer series correspond to emissions on the visible spectra. The Lyman series belong to the ultraviolet and the Paschen and Bracket series belongs to the infrared.
