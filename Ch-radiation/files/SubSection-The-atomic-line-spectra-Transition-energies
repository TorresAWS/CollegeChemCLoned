Bohr's models is able to explain the atomic spectrum of hydrogen. Each line in the spectrum represents a transition between two levels of energy. For example the line at 102nm represents the transition of an electron between the level three and the level one, we call this 3 $\rightarrow$ 1. The atomic spectrum of hydrogen is obtained by means of exciting hydrogen atoms with energy, so that the electron jumps from a lower level into a higher level. When the atom relaxes, it emits light as the electrons move back from high every levels into lower--more stable--levels. This is called an emission. The different possible emissions have names based on the person who discovered then. For example, the set of emissions that end up in the fundamental level ($n$=1) are called the Lyman series. Similarly, the set of emissions that end up in the level ($n$=2) are called the Balmer series. For example: 3 $\rightarrow$ 2, 4 $\rightarrow$ 2 or 5 $\rightarrow$ 2. Only the Balmer series correspond to emissions on the visible spectra. The Lyman series belong to the ultraviolet and the Paschen and Bracket series belong to the infrared.
