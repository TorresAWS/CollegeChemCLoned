The \emph{ionization energy} (IE) is the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom in a gas state and its fundamental (ground) electronic state. Atoms can have numerous ionization energies (see Table \ref{tab:Table-Ionization-energies}). The first ionization energy ($IE_1$) is the energy needed to remove the highest-energy electron on an atom, whereas the second ionization energy ($IE_2$) is the energy needed to remove the second highest-energy electron on the atom. 
For the case of boron,
\begin{center}\ce{B_{(g)} -> B^{+}_{(g)} + e^-} $\qquad   \text{IE}_1= 800.6kJ/mol$\\
 \ce{B^{+}_{(g)} -> B^{2+}_{(g)} + e^-} $\qquad   \text{IE}_2= 2427.1kJ/mol$ \\
 \ce{B^{2+}_{(g)} -> B^{3+}_{(g)} + e^-} $\qquad   \text{IE}_3= 3659.7kJ/mol$ \\
 \ce{B^{3+}_{(g)} -> B^{4+}_{(g)} + e^-} $\qquad   \text{IE}_4= 25025.8kJ/mol$ \end{center}
Given the electron configuration of Boron ($[\text{He}] \text{2s}^2 \text{2p}^1$), the first electron comes from a $p$ orbital, whereas the second comes from a $s$ orbital, which lays closer to the nucleus. The fourth electron comes from the core and the fourth ionization energy is considerably higher than the rest.
Overall, we have that ionizing an atom from $p$ orbitals is less costly than ionizing from $s$ orbitals, and ionizing an atom from core orbitals is more costly than ionizing from valence orbitals. 
The ionization energy increases (this means more energy is needed to remove an electron) going up a group and when going across a period from left to right. In general, the ionization energy is low for metals and high for nonmetals. For example, if we compare the IE for H and He, as He is further right in the same period, it will have a larger IE and more energy will be needed to remove an electron ($\text{IE}_{H}<IE_{He}$). For the case of Li and H, the EI will be higher for H as it is further up in the same group ($\text{IE}_{H}>IE_{Li}$). There are discontinuities in the IE when moving across a period. Table \ref{tab:Figure-Ionization-energy-plot} gives the IE for the second period. The first discontinuity happens between groups 2A and 3A as it is easier to remove p electrons than s electrons. The second discontinuity occurs between groups 5A and 6A as it is easier to remove an electron from a double occupies p orbital than from a single-occupied one.
