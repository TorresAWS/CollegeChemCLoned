The precise location of electrons in the atoms is unattainable. Differently, the electron location is described in terms of probability. An orbital is a three-dimensional area with the highest probability of finding an electron. Orbitals have different shapes and energy, as electrons in those have different stability. Some orbitals have a spherical shape, whereas others are lobular.
