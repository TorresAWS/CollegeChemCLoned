Some atomic properties are periodic, which means that they follow a certain trends in the periodic table. These properties increases or decreases across a period and then the trend is repeated again in each successive period or group. We will consider here five atomic properties: the effective charge, atomic (or ionic) size, the ionization energy, the metallic character and the electronegativity.
