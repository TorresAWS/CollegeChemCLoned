Elements from groups 1A, 2A, and 3A have low ionization energy and hence can easily lose their valence electrons forming cations (pronounced cat-eye-uns). For example, Potassium located in group 1A with electron configuration [Ar] 4s$^1$ can readily lose its only valence electron reaching the electron configuration or its core, Ar (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Cations}). When losing a negatively charged electron as the number of protons in the atom does not change, it acquires a positive ionic charge of $+1$. When a cation is formed the atomic radius, indeed the ionic radius also changes becoming smaller, as cations result from the loss of electron density. Ca with electron configuration [Ar] 4s$^2$ and located in the group 2S loses two electrons reaching the electron configuration of Ar, its noble gas core, and the ionic charge of Ca is $+2$.
