The Schr\"{o}dinger equation is the fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. It was formulated by Erwin Schr\"{o}dinger in 1926, an Austrian physicist, and it was based on complex mathematical techniques. This equation incorporates the electron behavior in terms of a particle through its mass and in terms of a wave through a wave-like function, $\Psi$.
 \begin{equation*}\begin{split}
\hat{\text{H}}\Psi=\text{E}\Psi
\end{split}\end{equation*}
$\hat{H}$ is called the hamiltonian operator and contains kinetic energy and potential energy component. $\Psi$, the wave function depends on the location of the space of each electron in the system. $E$ are the energy levels. The solution of this equation required advanced calculus and will not be covered here. In contrast to the simple algebraic equation in which an answer is a simple number, the result of solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is a set of functions and a number for each of these functions. The functions are called wavefunctions ($\{\Psi_1$, $\Psi_2$, ..., $\Psi_n\}$), and for each wavefunction there is an energy value, leading to a set of energy levels ($\{E_1$, $E_2$, ..., $E_n\}$).
The introduction of The Schr\"{o}dinger's equation mark the beginning of a new field in physics and chemistry called quantum mechanics or wave mechanics. Quantum mechanics do not allow us to specify the location of an electron in an atom, however, it allows us to identify the area in the space where the electron is most likely to be located at a given time. Electron density refers to the probability that an electron is found in a particular region of an atom.
