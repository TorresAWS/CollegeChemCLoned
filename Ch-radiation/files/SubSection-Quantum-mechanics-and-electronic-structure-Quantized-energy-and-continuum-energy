Quantum mechanics is a theory shared in physics and chemistry that describe the nature of matter. It is used to do modeling in chemistry--to model molecules and atoms. Think of an engineer designing a plane. Before building and selling the plane engineers carry computer-based modeling to ensure the plane will work properly. In a similar way, chemists carry modeling to describe the properties of chemicals. The theory behind engineering modeling is classical mechanics, based in Newton's law.The theory behind chemistry modeling is quantum mechanics, based in Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Classical mechanics is based on the idea that the energy of a system, a plane or a car, is continuum, that is, the car or a plane can have any possible energy, starting from zero to any number you can think of. 
Differently, quantum mechanics is based in the idea that the energy of a system, an atom or a molecule, is quantized, that is it can only be certain specific values.
