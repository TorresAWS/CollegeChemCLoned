Quantum mechanics is a theory shared in physics and chemistry that describes the nature of matter. It is used to do modeling in chemistry--to model molecules and atoms. Think of an engineer designing a plane. Before building and selling the plane engineers carry out computer-based modeling to ensure the plane will work properly. Similarly, chemists carry out modeling to describe the properties of chemicals. The theory behind engineering modeling is classical mechanics, based on Newton's law. The theory behind chemistry modeling is quantum mechanics, based on Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Classical mechanics is based on the idea that the energy of a system, a plane or a car, is a continuum, that is, the car or a plane can have any possible energy, starting from zero to any number you can think of. 
Differently, quantum mechanics is based on the idea that the energy of a system, an atom or a molecule, is quantized, that is it can only be certain specific values.
