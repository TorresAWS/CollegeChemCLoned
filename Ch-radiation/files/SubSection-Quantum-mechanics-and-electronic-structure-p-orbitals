There are three different $p$ orbitals and each subshell with $n$ larger than 2 has a $p$ orbital. These three $p$ orbitals are labeled $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$, where the subindexes represent the direction of the axis along which each orbital is oriented. All three $p$ orbitals have the same size, shape and energy. The larger the principal quantum number the larger the size of the orbital, and for example a 3$p_x$ is larger than a 2$p_x$. There is no relationship between the subindex labels and the values of $m_\ell$. The boundary surface diagrams of $p$ orbitals expose their shape in the form of two lobes, and with positive and one with negative sign.
