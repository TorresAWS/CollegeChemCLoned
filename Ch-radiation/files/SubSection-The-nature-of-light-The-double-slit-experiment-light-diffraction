The double-slit experiment was intended to demonstrate the wave nature of light. When a source of light passes through a narrow opening called a slit a bright spot is generated on the other side of the slit. When a source of light passes through two slits surprising results arise. 
One would expect to see two bright spots, one per slit. However, what you really would see would be a series of bright spots and dark spots, resulting from the interference of light. As light is a wave it can interfere and light plus light does not always gives more light, and can sometimes genera darkness. The bright spots result from the constructive interference of the light waves whereas the dark spots result from the destructive interference. Overall, waves propagate energy and the results of the propagation can be more light or less light depending on how these waves interfere.\\
