This section will explain the atomic spectra of atoms and in particular, hydrogen. Atoms emit light, but not any type of light as they emit specific frequencies of radiation. The atomic spectrum is a representation of the different wavelengths of the radiation emitted--or absorbed--by an atom. This section will gain insight into the reasons for the emission of specific frequencies of light and will introduce the Bohr model that justifies the lines in the atomic spectrum of hydrogen.
