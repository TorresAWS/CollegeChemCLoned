In quantum mechanics the wave function $\Psi$ of an atom or a molecule (a system) is a complex function--it has an imaginary component--that contains all information of the system. Using this function, we can simulate the behavior of the system and extract its properties. You want to think of $\Psi$ as a box that contains information, in particular all information of the system you want to simulate. When expressed in spherical coordinates, $\Psi$ depends on the position ($r$) and two angles ($\theta$ and $\varphi$) of each electron of the system. This function $\Psi$ \emph{per se} has no real meaning or interpretation. Differently, $\Psi^2$
its square value has a real physical interpretation, representing the probability of finding an electron near a particular point in space. An orbital is a single-electron wave function. In other words, is a wave function that contains information about a single electron. The square value of an orbital represents the probability of finding an electron at a specific location. Electrons are very different than larger objects such as a tennis ball. Larger objects are localized, that is they are located at a specific point in space. Differently, electrons are delocalized, which means they are not located at a single point in space and time, and therefore we can only guess the probability of finding the electron at a specific point. Orbitals are mathematical functions with a radian and an angular component.
 \begin{equation*}
\Psi(r, \theta, \varphi)=\psi_{n} (r) \cdot Y_{\ell}^{m_\ell}(\theta, \varphi)
\end{equation*}
The radial part $\psi_{n} (r)$ describes how the orbital changes with the distance ($r$) along the space, whereas the angular part--these are called spherical harmonics, $Y_{\ell}^{m_\ell}$--describes the symmetry of the orbital. As a note, the term orbital is different than the term orbit, which is used in classical physics to describe the trajectory of an object (e.g. a planet) and was used in Bohr's model to describe the different states of motion of the electrons in the hydrogen atom. When we say that an electron is located at a given orbital, we mean that the electron density distribution is described by the square of the wavefunction associated with that orbital.
