In an atom, electrons are located at different levels. Each electron has a specific energy referred to as an \emph{energy level} or energy shell (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Energy-levels-and-orbitals}). This means that the energy of an electron is quantized, and it is not a continuous property: electrons can not have any energy value and can only have specific energy values. Electrons with the same energy are located at the same energy level. At the same time, some levels have lower energy and the electron in these levels are close to the nucleus being also strongly attached to it, whereas other levels have higher energy, and the electrons in these levels are less attached to the nucleus. Energy levels are labeled with a number $n$ that equals a single number such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. The first energy level is $n=1$ and never $n=0$--think of this as an apartment in a building, the first floor is flour one. For example, all electrons in level one $n=1$ have the same energy. There is a limit to the number of electrons in an energy level and we call this occupancy. Only a few electrons can occupy the lower energy levels, while more electrons can be accommodated in higher energy levels.  Level one can only fit two electrons, whereas level two can fit a total number of eight electrons. The maximum number of electrons allowed in any energy level is calculated using the formula 
\begin{equation}
2n^2 
\end{equation}
in which $n$ is the energy level. You can see by using this formula that for example, the third level can accommodate 18 electrons. Changes in energy levels imply energy exchange. For example, an electron absorbs energy when going from level 1 to level 2, and releases energy when going from level 3 to level 1. And the trend continues.
