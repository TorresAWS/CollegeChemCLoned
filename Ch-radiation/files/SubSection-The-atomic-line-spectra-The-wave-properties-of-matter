Bohr's model was able to explain the experimental data for the hydrogen spectrum. Still, scientists--not even Bohr himself--did not know why electrons were restricted to moving in specific orbits. Louis de Broglie solved this question by suggesting that if light can behave--under some conditions--as a particle, perhaps particles such as electrons, can also behave as a wave--under certain circumstances (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Debroglie}). De Broglie deduced that a particle and wave are related by the following expression:
 \begin{equation*}
\lambda=\frac{h}{ m\cdot v}
\end{equation*}
where:
\begin{where}
 \item $\lambda$   is De Broglie's wavelength of a particle
  \item $6.6\times 10^{-34}$Js is called Plank's constant, $h$
 \item $m\cdot v$  is the momentum of a particle, p, that depends on the mass and velocity of the particle
\end{where}
In general, the wavelength of a particle is referred to as the De Broglie wavelength and the mass associated with a wavelength is called the De Broglie mass. De Broglie came to this conclusion using the following reasoning: if an electron in the hydrogen atoms behaves like a wave then its wavelength ($\lambda$) must fill the length of the circular orbit ($2\pi r$) so that
 \begin{equation*}
n\lambda=2\pi r
\end{equation*}
