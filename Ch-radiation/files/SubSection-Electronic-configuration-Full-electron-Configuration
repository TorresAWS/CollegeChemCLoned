The full electron configuration of an atom is obtained by placing the total number of electrons of the atom in different orbitals with increasing energy. For example, the electron configuration for helium is written as 

\begin{center}He $1s^2$\end{center} 

and the one for Li is
\begin{center}Li $1s^2 2s^1$\end{center} 
 
First, how do we know the total number of electrons in an atom? That is the same as the atomic number and is indicated in the periodic table. Look for the element and the atomic number is on the top left side of the element. For example, the atomic number of hydrogen is one, and the number of electrons in He is two. Similarly, nitrogen has seven electrons. Second, how do we know which orbitals need to be filled? Figure \ref{Fig:SideFigure-Orbital-filling-diagram} shows the orbital order. You need to start from the top of the image, from orbital $1s$, and proceed to the next arrow, starting from the end of the arrow. This way, after $1s$ goes $2s$ and then $2p$, $3s$, $3p$, $4s$, and $3d$. Mind that every $s$ orbital can only fit two electrons, and $p$ orbitals can fit six electrons, and so on. The following example will help you construct the electron configuration for a given atom.
