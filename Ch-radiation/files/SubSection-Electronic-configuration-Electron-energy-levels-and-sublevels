The electrons in an atom are arranged in different energy levels. Some levels have lower energy and the electron in these levels are close to the nucleus being also strongly attached to it, whereas other levels have higher energy and the electrons in these levels are less attached to the nucleus. Still, each electron in an energy level have the same energy. The energy levels are labeled with a number $n$ that equals to a single number such as 1, 2, 3 and so on. The first energy level is $n=1$ and never $n=0$--think of this as an apartment in a building, the first floor is flour one. For example all electrons in level one $n=1$ have the same energy. There is a limit to the number of electrons in an energy level and we call this occupancy. Only a few electrons can occupy the lower energy levels, while more electrons can be accommodated in higher energy levels.  Level one can only fit two electrons, whereas level two can fit a total number of eight electrons. The maximum number of electrons allowed in any energy level is calculated using the formula 
\begin{equation}
2n^2 
\end{equation}
in which $n$ is the energy level. You can see by using this formula that for example, the third level can accommodate 18 electrons.
Each energy level consists of one or more sublevels, which contain electrons with identical energy. The number of sublevels in each level corresponds to $n$. For example, in the first energy level ($n=1$) we have only one sublevel, whereas in the third energy level ($n=3$) we have three sublevels.
