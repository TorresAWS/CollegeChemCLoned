In an atom, electrons are located in different levels, and each electron has a specific energy called an energy level. This means that the energy of an electron is quantized, not being a continuous property. For example, in the case of hydrogen, the orbitals of hydrogen have different energy depending on the principal quantum number, $n$. The 1$s$ orbital has the most negative--stable--energy. The 2$s$ and 2$p$ orbitals have both the same energy and overall have a more positive energy than the 1$s$. The orbitals in the third shell have more positive energy than the orbitals in the previous shell. Changes in energy levels imply energy exchange. For example, an electron absorbs energy when going from level 1 to level 2, and releases energy when going from level 3 to level 1. And the trend continues. Electrons located in lower energy levels are closer to the nucleus.
All electrons with the same energy are located in the same energy level. For example, electrons in an orbital 2$p$ have the same energy. Each of the energy levels consists of one or more than one sublevels containing electrons with the same energy. The sublevels are identified by the letter $s$, $p$, $d$, or $f$. The number of sublevels within a level equals the principal quantum number $n$. For example, in level one we only have one sublevel $s$, however, in level two we have two sublevels, the $s$
 and $p$.
