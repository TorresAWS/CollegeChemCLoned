The orbitals of hydrogen have different energy depending on the principal quantum number. The 1$s$ orbital has the most negative--stable--energy. The 2$s$ and 2$p$ orbitals have both the same energy and overall have a more positive energy than the 1$s$. The orbitals at the third shell have a more positive energy than the orbitals in the previous shell. And the trend continues.
