Most chemical elements are found in nature combined with other elements, forming compounds. An exception is the noble gases which only combine with other elements under very extreme conditions. The reason for the stability of noble gases--their inability to form compounds--result from their electronic configuration: all noble gases have a valence shell filled with electrons, without empty orbitals. Elements combine through an electron exchange process; they receive or gain electron density, or simply electrons, to achieve a stable electron configuration. In other words, they exchange electrons to acquire an octet of eight valence electrons. Ions are atoms with an electrical charge that result from the process of gaining or losing electrons so that atoms reach a stable electron configuration.
