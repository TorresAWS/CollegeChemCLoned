The electron affinity (EA) represents the tendency of an atom to receive one or more electrons hence becoming negatively charged.  Specifically, is the energy involved in the process of receiving an electron. As an example, the electron affinity of hydrogen is written as:
\begin{center}\ce{H_{(g)} + e^-     -> H^{-}_{(g)} } $\qquad   \text{EA}_1= -195kJ/mol$  \end{center}
Here, we consider electron affinities as negative values so that the smaller (the more negative) this value the larger the tendency of the atom to accept electrons. In other words, it would be easier to add electrons to an atom with -10kJ/mol EA, than to an atom with 10kJ/mol EA. In the periodic table, EA decreases (becomes more negative) across a period from left to right. For example, EA for K is -48kJ/mol and for Br is --325kJ/mol. Hence, elements from the right of the table are more willing to gain electrons than elements from the left. On one hand, there are discontinuities in the electron affinity across a period. It is easier to add an electron to the elements in Group 1A than to elements in Group 2A, as an electron added to Group 2 elements would be placed in $p$ orbitals and these have higher--more positive--energies. Also, it is easier to add an electron to the elements in Group 4A than to elements in Group 5A, as an electron added to Group 4 elements would be placed in $p$ orbitals giving three unpaired electrons, whereas electrons on Group 5 are all paired and a new electron would have to add to an already occupied orbital. On the other hand, there are fewer EA variations when going across a group. Finally, when adding more than one electron, the second EA tends to be more positive--less favored--than the first electron addition.
