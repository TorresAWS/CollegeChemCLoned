The nuclear charge (Z) of an atom is the number of protons in the nucleus. In atoms with more than one electron, each electron is exposed to a nuclear effective charge ($\text{Z}_{eff}$) as the electrons partially compensate for the nuclear charge creating an effective nuclear charge. This way, the effective nuclear charge is the actual magnitude of the positive charge experienced by an electron. In atoms with many electrons, an electron is partially shielded from the positive charge of the nucleus. Among the different types of electrons in an atom (valence and core), core electrons are more effective at shielding, and as such $\text{Z}_{eff}$ increases from left to right across the periodic table. As the number of core electrons remains the same and the atomic number increases from left to right across the table, $\text{Z}_{eff}$ follows this trend too. The effective nuclear charge is given by
\begin{equation*}
\text{Z}_{eff}=\text{Z} - \sigma
\end{equation*}
where $\sigma$ is the shielding constant.
