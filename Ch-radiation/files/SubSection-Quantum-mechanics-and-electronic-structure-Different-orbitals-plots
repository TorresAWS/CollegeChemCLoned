It is not straightforward to represent orbitals, as they extend throughout the space. However, there are three common ways to represent $s$ orbitals, and in general any orbital: (a) by means of the surface that contains 90\% of the total electron probability, (b) by means of the orbital square, and (c) by means of the radial probability distribution. Let us elaborate on the meaning of radial probability distribution. Imagine the space is made of thin shells, like in the layers of an onion. By adding all shells we have the whole space. The radial probability distribution is the total probability of finding an electron in each shell which depends on the distance from the nucleus. The radial probability distribution is useful as the maximums on this function indicate the distances from the nucleus where it is most likely to find the electrons on a particular orbital.
