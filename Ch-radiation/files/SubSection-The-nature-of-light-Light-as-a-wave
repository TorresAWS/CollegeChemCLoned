Light behaves as a wave. Waves are characterized by their frequency, wavelength, and amplitude (see figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Properties-of-waves}). The wavelength of a wave ($\lambda$, lambda) is the distance between identical points on successive waves (or successive peaks). The frequency of a wave ($\nu$, nu) is the number of waves that pass through a particular point in one second. The amplitude ($A$) of a wave is the vertical distance from the zero to the top of the peak, or from the zero to the bottom of the peak. The amplitude of a wave is related to the intensity of the radiation. The speed of light through the vacuum is $3\times 10^{8}$m/s. However, the speed of light depends on the medium and light tends to slow down when traveling in a medium different than a vacuum.
