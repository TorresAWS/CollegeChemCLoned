Atoms gaining or losing electrons become ions. When an atom loses an electron it reduces its size. In particular, when an atom loses all valence electrons its size reduces considerably. When an atom gains an electron it gains size too as this new electron needs to be placed on an occupied orbital further away from the nucleus.
Some ions have a common electronic configuration. For example, \ce{Na^{+}} and  \ce{F^{-}} both have the electron configuration: $[He] \text{2s}^2 \text{2p}^6$. Ions with the same electron configuration are called isoelectronic. For a series of isoelectronic ions, the larger the atomic number the smaller the ionic size due to the increase in nuclear attraction (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Atomic-radiu}).
