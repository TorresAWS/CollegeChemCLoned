Newton showed that sunlight (white light) is composed of various components of different colors. A similar type of radiation called emission spectra can be produced by heating a substance. Think for example of a hot piece of metal. Both the sun and a heated piece of metal have in common the fact that their spectrum is continuous and contains all wavelengths of visible light.
We can achieve a similar effect by applying a high-voltage electrical discharge to a gas. The atomic line spectrum of a gas is a set of lines on a black (or sometimes white) background. These lines correspond to radiation emitted (or absorbed) by atoms. Some of these lines correspond to the visible spectrum, that is, have color--these are called the Balmer series. Other lines correspond to other parts of the spectra of radiation. This spectrum is historically important and was used to understand the structure of the electrons in the atom. In contrast to the sunlight spectrum, the atomic spectrum of a gas is not continuous but quantized.
