Let's gain deeper insight into the idea of an energy level. These are just numbers that represent the location--in energy units--of the different states that an electron can occupy in an hydrogen atom. The first level is $E_1$ and is the most negative energy value, being also the most stable level. In another words, the electrons in this level are tightly bonded to the nucleus. This energy levels is called the fundamental energy level.
The following levels ($E_2$, $E_3$, $\cdots$, $E_n$) have a more positive energy. 
For example, comparing $E_2$ and $E_4$, we have that an electron on the level number four ($E_4=-0.85eV$) is less stable than on level two ($E_2=-3.40eV$). Hence it would be easier to remove an electron from level number four than from level two. For small $n$ values the levels are spread from each other. However, when $n$ increases, the energy levels are more and more closer to each other. Electrons occupying energy levels with $n$ higher than one are called excited states.
Finally, there are infinite number of levels and the highest energy ($E_\infty$) level has an energy of 0J. The electron transitions between the different energy levels is what generates the emission spectrum of hydrogen.
