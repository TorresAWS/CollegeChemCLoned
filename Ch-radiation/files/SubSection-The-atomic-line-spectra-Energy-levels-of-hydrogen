Let's gain deeper insight into the idea of an energy level. These are just numbers that represent the location--in energy units--of the different states that an electron can occupy in a hydrogen atom. The first level is $E_1$ and is the most negative energy value, being also the most stable level. In other words, the electrons in this level are tightly bonded to the nucleus. This energy level is called the fundamental energy level.
The following levels ($E_2$, $E_3$, $\cdots$, $E_n$) have more positive energy. 
For example, comparing $E_2$ and $E_4$, we have that an electron on level number four ($E_4=-0.85eV$) is less stable than on level two ($E_2=-3.40eV$). Hence it would be easier to remove an electron from level number four than from level two. For small $n$ values the levels are spread from each other. However, when $n$ increases, the energy levels are closer and closer to each other. Electrons occupying energy levels with $n$ higher than one are called excited states.
Finally, there are an infinite number of levels and the highest energy ($E_\infty$) level has an energy of 0J. The electron transitions between the different energy levels are what generate the emission spectrum of hydrogen (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Energy-levels-of-hydrogen}).
