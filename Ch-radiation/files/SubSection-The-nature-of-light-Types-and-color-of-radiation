Depending on its frequency--or on its wavelength--radiation can be classified as gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet (UV), visible, infrared (IR), microwaves, or radio waves. For example, radiation with a wavelength of $10^{-2}$ nm belongs to gamma rays radiation, whereas radiation with a wavelength of $10^{4}$ nm belongs to the Infrared. Gamma rays are the most energetic type of radiation, whereas radio waves are the less energetic waves. At the same time, radio waves have the largest wavelength.
Light does not always have color. Only a small range of wavelengths belong to visible radiation and the visible spectrum corresponds to the set of visible frequencies. This means you will not be able to see, for example, IR radiation or gamma rays. The color of the radiation is also dependent on the wavelength--of the frequency as both are related--and for example $\lambda=450$ nm will be blue light. Ultraviolet radiation is the most energetic visible radiation whereas infrared waves are the less energetic waves of the visible spectrum.
