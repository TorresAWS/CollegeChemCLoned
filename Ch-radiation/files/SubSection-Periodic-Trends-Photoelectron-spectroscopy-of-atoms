Photoelectron spectroscopy is a technique used to measure the relative binding of the electrons of an atom. It is useful to experimentally obtain the energy levels of an atom and properties such as the ionization energy. The principle behind the technique is similar to the photoelectric effect. By shining light with enough energy, one can remove electrons from an atom. By measuring the kinetic energy of the ejected electron and taking into account the energy of the radiation we can estimate the binding energy of the ejected electron--called photoelectron--in the atom. The name, photoelectron spectroscopy, refers to the fact that electrons are ejected with light, by using photons. This technique is used to identify the presence of specific atoms as the photoelectron picks are element-specific, that is, each element presents a series of characteristic peaks. However, many factors affect the photoelectron picks and for example, a 1s peak of H can appear at different energies depending on the nature of the atom bonded to hydrogen. In general, on the vertical axis of a PES plot, you will find the relative intensity of the electrons and on the horizontal axis the energy of the photoelectron. The larger the energy the more strongly attached will be the electron in the atom and for example, a 1s peak will appear at higher energy than a 2s peak. The higher the intensity of the pick the larger the number of electrons in the level resulting in the photoelectron. For example, the intensity of a $1s^2$ peak should be twice the intensity of a $1s$ peak. By comparing the intensity of the peaks and the relative location one can identify the atom represented on the spectra.
