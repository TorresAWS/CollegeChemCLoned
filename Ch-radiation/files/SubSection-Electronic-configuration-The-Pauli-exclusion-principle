The Pauli exclusion principle states that there can not exist two electrons in an atom with the same values of the four quantum numbers. It tells that each electron is unique and it has to be differentiated with a unique combination of quantum numbers. Because of this, each orbital can only accommodate two different electrons, one with $-1/2$ spin and one with $+1/2$.
