The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values of the four quantum numbers. It tells that each electron is unique and it has to be differentiated with a unique combination of quantum numbers. Because of this, each orbital can only accommodate two different electrons, one with $-1/2$ spin and one with $+1/2$.
