Bohr's model was simplistic but still, it was able to correctly predict the fine structure of hydrogen--the atomic spectrum of hydrogen--and the energy transitions. The downside of this model resulted from considering that the electron moves in different orbits and that it did not provide a complete description of the behavior of the electrons in atoms. A correct assumption of the model was that the energy levels of the atom were quantized--electrons can only exist in specific energy levels characterized by the number $n$ and not in a continuum of energy. This section will cover a more realistic theory that describes the structure of the atom: quantum mechanics. The outcomes of this section are the existence of orbitals and quantum numbers.
