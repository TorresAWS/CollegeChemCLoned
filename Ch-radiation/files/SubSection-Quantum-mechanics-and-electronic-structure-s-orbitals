There is a single $s$ subshell in every shell and each $s$ subshell contains only a single orbital.
For example, in the first energy level, there is a 1s orbital, whereas, in the second energy level, there is a 2s orbital. All $s$ orbitals have an overall spherical shape with increasing size depending on the principal quantum number $n$ (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Orbitals-s}). For example, the 1$s$ orbital is smaller than the 2$s$, and so on.
