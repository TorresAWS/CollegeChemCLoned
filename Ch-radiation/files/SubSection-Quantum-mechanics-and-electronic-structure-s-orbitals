$s$ orbitals are characterized as having $n=0$. There is a single $s$ subshell in every shell and each $s$ subshell contains only a single orbital. All $s$ orbitals have an overall spherical shape with increasing size depending on the principal quantum number $n$. For example, the 1$s$ orbital is smaller than the 2$s$, and so on. The probability density plot shows an interesting feature. For the 2$s$ plot, the graph shows a minimum--called a node--representing the distance from the nucleus where the probability of finding an electron is zero. The number of nodes depends on the principal quantum number so that 1$s$ orbitals has zero nodes, 2$s$ has one node, and 3$s$ has two nodes, and so on.
