Waves result from the propagation of energy and are not localized. Electrons behave as waves under certain conditions. To approach the problem of trying to locate a particle that behaves as a wave, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to measure simultaneously both the momentum ($m\cdot v$) and the position ($x$) of a particle. In another words, the uncertainty of the position ($\Delta x$) and the uncertainty on the momentum ($m\cdot \Delta v$) are linked by the relationship:
\begin{equation}
\Delta x\cdot m\Delta v \geq \frac{h}{4\pi} 
\end{equation}
This relation, involving Plank's constant $h$, should be interpreted as: if the uncertainty of the position is large, then the uncertainty of the velocity (or momentum) must be small. And the minimum values for the product of uncertainties if $\frac{h}{4\pi} $.
