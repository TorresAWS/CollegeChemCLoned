In Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, just a single number $n$ was necessary to describe the electron state. Differently, in quantum mechanics, each orbital $\Psi_{n, \ell, m_\ell}$ is characterized by three quantum numbers. These numbers differentiate each orbital from the rest. They are called: the principal quantum number $n$, the angular quantum number $\ell$, and the magnetic quantum number $m_{\ell}$. These quantum numbers are interrelated and not all combinations are allowed. We will describe this in the following, but just as an example, a possible combination would be $\Psi_{1,0, 0}$ and $\Psi_{1,1, 0}$ would be an impossible combination. Table \ref{tab:Table-quantum} displays orbital labels and quantum number relationships. In the following, we will describe each quantum number separately.
