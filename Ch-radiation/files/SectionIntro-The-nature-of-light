Light--also called electromagnetic radiation--is a form or energy. When talking about light we normally refer to visible radiation. However, there are many different types of radiation. Think about the light coming from a bulb, or the radiation that warms up your food in a microwave, or even when you warm up a pizza in the over. This section will cover the properties of light.
