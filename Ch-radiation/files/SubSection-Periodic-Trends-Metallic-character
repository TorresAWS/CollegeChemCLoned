All elements in the periodic table have somehow a certain \emph{metallic character} as they all can lose electrons as metals do--that is why metals are good conductors. The elements in the left part of the table are metals with a strong metallic character. Still, the elements on the right side of the table also have a certain metallic character (MC). The metallic character increases (the atom is more metallic) when going down a group (column) of the table and when going across a period (row) from right to left. For example, comparing K and Ca, we have that K is more metallic than Ca, as it is located further to the left in the same column ($MC_{K}>MC_{Ca}$). In the case of F and Cl, Cl is more metallic as it is located further down a group ($MC_{Cl}>MC_{F}$).
