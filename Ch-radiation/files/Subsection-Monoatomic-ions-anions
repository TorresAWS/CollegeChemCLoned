Elements from groups 4A, 5A, and 6A have high ionization energy and hence can easily gain valence electrons forming anions (pronounced an-eye-uns). For example, F located in group 7A with electron configuration [He] 2s$^2$ 2p$^5$ can readily gain one valence electron reaching the electron configuration or Ne. When gaining a negatively charged electron as the number of protons in the atom does not change, it acquires a negative ionic charge of $-1$. Similarly, O located in group 6A with electron configuration [He] 2s$^2$ 2p$^4$ can readily gain two valence electrons reaching the electron configuration or Ne. When gaining two negatively charged electrons, it acquires two negative ionic charges $-2$.
