There is a more convenient way to labels orbitals than the $\Psi_{n,\ell, m_{\ell}}$ notation. In this notation, $s$ orbitals are orbitals with $\ell=0$, whereas $p$ orbitals have $\ell=1$ and $d$ orbitals have $\ell=2$. Finally, $f$ orbitals have $\ell=3$. The principal quantum number should also be indicated before the label. For example, the orbitals $\Psi_{2,0, 0}$ is a 2$s$ ($\Psi_{2s}$) and the orbital $\Psi_{2,1, -1}$ is a 2$p$, that is $\Psi_{2p}$. The magnetic quantum number is not indicated in this notation. This is the most extended notation used to represent and refer to orbitals.
