Each of the energy levels consists of one or more than one sublevel or subshell. The number of sublevels within a level equals the principal quantum number 
\begin{equation}
 n  
\end{equation}
being identified by a letter $s$, $p$, $d$, or $f$. For example, in level one we only have one sublevel called the $s$ level, however, in level two we have two sublevels, the $s$, and $p$ levels. In level three we have three sublevels, the $s$, the $p$, and the $d$ levels. Finally, in level four we have four sublevels, the $s$, the $p$, the $p$, and the $d$ levels.
