Atoms in general contain numerous orbitals and each orbital should be filled with electrons. In every orbital you can fill only a maximum number of electrons. For example, in a $s$ orbital you can place a maximum of two electrons. That is why you will find $s^1$ orbitals and $s^2$, with the latest being completely filled with electrons. In a $p$ orbital you can place a maximum of six electrons and in a $d$ orbital a maximum of ten. Finally, in a $f$ orbital you can place fourteen or less electrons. For example, the orbital notation $p^2$ is correct as in $p$ orbitals you can place six or less electrons. In this case, this orbital still have space to accept more electrons. Differently, the notation $d^{12}$ is incorrect, as in $d$ orbitals you can fit ten or less electrons and never twelve. The aufbau (build up) principle states that the electronic configuration of an atom can be obtained by adding one by one all electrons in the element. In order to fill the orbitals you should follow the Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter}. You start from the top of the table and follow the arrows that indicates the orbitals ordering. For examples the first orbital to be filled will be $1s$. After that you should fill  $2s$ and  $2p$. After that you should fill $3s$, $3p$, $4s$, $3d$, and $4p$. There is a maximum number of electrons that can occupy each orbital. An s orbital holds a maximum of 2 electrons. A p orbital takes up to 6 electrons, a d orbital can hold up to 10 electrons, and an f orbital holds a maximum of 14 electrons. An orbital can be completely filled with electrons, partially filled or empty. For example a $3s^1$ is half-filled with one electrons and $2p^6$ is completely filled. Another example, a $3d$ orbital is empty and can accommodate a maximum of 10 electrons.
