There are five $d$ orbitals labeled as $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$. The subindexes in the labels are related to the orientation of the orbital in space. None of the $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$  orbitals cross any of the axis, but  $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ do. In particular, the lobes of the $d_{xy}$ orbitals are located in the $xy$ plane, whereas $d_{x^2-y^2}$ cross the $x$ and $y$ axis and the $d_{z^2}$ crosses the $z$ axis. All five $d$ orbitals have the same energy. These orbitals increase in size based on the principal quantum number and the 3$d$ orbitals are smaller than 4$d$. There are no $d$ orbitals in the first or second shell. Regarding the $f$ orbitals, there are seven orbitals with very complex shapes (see Figure \ref{Fig:Figure-Orbitals-d}).
