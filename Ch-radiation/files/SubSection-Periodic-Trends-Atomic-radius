The size of atoms can not be specified exactly as the electron density of atoms stands throughout space. Still, we can arbitrarily define the atomic radii of atoms which are obtained by measuring distances between atoms in compounds. For covalent molecules, for example, \ce{O2}, we can measure the distance between the atoms in the molecule which is close to 150 pm, hence the atomic radius of oxygen--called the covalent atomic radius--should be close to 75pm. For metallic elements, we can measure the metallic radii using the lattice spacing between atoms. In the periodic table, the atomic radii decrease from left to right of a period and increased from top to bottom of a group.
