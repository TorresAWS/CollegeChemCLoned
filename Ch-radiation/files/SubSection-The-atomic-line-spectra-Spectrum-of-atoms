The absorption spectrum of an atom is a representation of the different frequencies in which an atom absorbs or emits radiation. Each atoms has a distinctive emission spectrum. Some of these lines correspond to the visible spectrum, that is, they can be seen. Others correspond higher or lower parts of the spectrum. This section will cover the spectrum of hydrogen.
