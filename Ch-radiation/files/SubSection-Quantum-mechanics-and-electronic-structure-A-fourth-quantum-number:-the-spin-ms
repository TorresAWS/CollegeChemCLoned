Three quantum numbers are necessary to describe each orbital. Still, a fourth quantum number, the spin number $m_s$ was necessary to understand why magnetic fields affect the emission spectra lines of hydrogen and sodium. $m_s$ is called \emph{spin quantum number} and can only be either $+^1/_2$ or $-^1/_2$.
