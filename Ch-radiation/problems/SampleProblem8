How many electrons can you fit in the energy level n=3.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large Solution} }\\
We will use the formula $2n^2 $ that gives the number of electrons that fit in a energy level $n$. As $n=3$, we can fit 18 electrons in this level. Remember, the larger the energy level the more electrons we can fit. \\
