Obtain the full electronic configuration of C.\\
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large Solution} }\\
The atomic number of C is Z=6 and that means C has 6 electrons. The orbital order from Figure \ref{Fig:{\chapterlabel}\thefigurenewcounter} is: $1s$,$2s$, $2p$, $3s$, etc. Each $s$ orbital can fit two electrons, whereas the occupancy of  the $p$ orbitals is six electrons. Hence the electronic configuration of C is: $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The $s$ orbitals are all filled, whereas the $p$ orbital is only occupied with two electrons.
