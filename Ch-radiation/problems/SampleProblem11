Compare the following property for the given couple of elements:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Atomic radius of N and F.
\item Ionization energy of Na and Cs.
\item Electronegativity of F and I.
\item Metallic character of N and F. 
\end{enumerate}
\textlcsc{ \textcolor{dgreen}{\Large \textbf{Solution}} }\\
(a) You go from N to F by moving from left to right on a row of the periodic table, hence the radius of N is larger than the radius of F. This is because the atomic radius decreases from left to right on a row.
(b) You go from Na to Cs by moving from up to down on a column of the periodic table, hence the ionization energy of Na is larger than for Cs. This is because the ionization energy decreases from top to bottom on a period.
(c) You go from F to I by moving from down to up on a column of the periodic table, hence the electronegativity of F is larger than for I. This is because the electronegativity energy increased from bottom to top on a period.
(d) You go from N to F by moving from left to right on a row of the periodic table, hence the metallic character of N is larger than for F. This is because the metallic character increased from right to left on a period.
